#     NAME
#       extractDomainResource.sh - Create a domain resource file for Kubernetes deployment.
#
#     DESCRIPTION
#       This script creates a domain resource file for Kubernetes deployment.
#
# This script uses the following variables:
#
# JAVA_HOME             - The location of the JDK to use.  The caller must set
#                         this variable to a valid Java 7 (or later) JDK.
#
# WLSDEPLOY_HOME        - The location of the WLS Deploy installation.
#                         If the caller sets this, the callers location will be
#                         honored provided it is an existing directory.
#                         Otherwise, the location will be calculated from the
#                         location of this script.
#
# WLSDEPLOY_PROPERTIES  - Extra system properties to pass to Java.  The caller
#                         can use this environment variable to add additional
#                         system properties to the Java environment.
