#     NAME
#       discoverDomain.sh - WLS Deploy tool to discover a domain.
#
#     DESCRIPTION
#       This script discovers the model of an existing domain and gathers
#       the binaries needed to recreate the domain elsewhere with all of
#       its applications and resources configured.
#
# This script uses the following variables:
#
# JAVA_HOME             - The path to the Java Home directory used by the ORACLE HOME.
#                         This overrides the JAVA_HOME value when locating attributes
#                         which will be replaced with the java home global token in the model
#
# WLSDEPLOY_HOME        - The location of the WLS Deploy installation.
#                         If the caller sets this, the callers location will be
#                         honored provided it is an existing directory.
#                         Otherwise, the location will be calculated from the
#                         location of this script.
#
# WLSDEPLOY_PROPERTIES  - Extra system properties to pass to WLST.  The caller
#                         can use this environment variable to add additional
#                         system properties to the WLST environment.
