#     NAME
#       encryptModel.sh - WLS Deploy tool to encrypt the password fields in
#                         the model and any referenced variables.
#
#     DESCRIPTION
#       This script searches the model file and variable file, if provided,
#       looking for password fields and encrypts them using the supplied
#       passphrase.  This passphrase must be passed to other tools in
#       order for them to be able to decrypt the passwords.  Please note
#       this feature requires JDK 1.8 or higher due to the encryption
#       algorithms selected.
#
# This script uses the following variables:
#
# JAVA_HOME             - The location of the JDK to use.  The caller must set
#                         this variable to a valid Java 8 (or later) JDK.
#
# WLSDEPLOY_HOME        - The location of the WLS Deploy installation.
#                         If the caller sets this, the callers location will be
#                         honored provided it is an existing directory.
#                         Otherwise, the location will be calculated from the
#                         location of this script.
#
# WLSDEPLOY_PROPERTIES  - Extra system properties to pass to Java.  The caller
#                         can use this environment variable to add additional
#                         system properties to the Java environment.
