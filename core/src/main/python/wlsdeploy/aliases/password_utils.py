Contains methods for special processing of dual-password attributes.
Dual-password attributes follow a common pattern in WLST, with the following rules.
These examples will use a prefix of Password*, but there are others throughout WLST.

Offline:
1. There is a single attribute name that includes the suffix, such as "PasswordEncrypted".
2. The attribute can be set to an encrypted ("{AES}...") or unencrypted value.
3. When the value is read, it is always encrypted.

Online:
1. There are two attributes, with and without the prefix, such as "Password" and "PasswordEncrypted". Both
   represent the same underlying value.
2. The encrypted attribute can only be set to an encrypted value.
3. The unencrypted attribute can only be set to an unencrypted value.
4. Only the unencrypted value can be read, and that value is encrypted.

In the alias file, these fields are flagged with the "password" WLST type, and the WLST name ends with "Encrypted".

The discovery code makes special provisions to skip the unencrypted online attribute.

The create and deploy code makes special provisions to set either the encrypted unencrypted online attribute,
depending on whether the model value is encrypted.
