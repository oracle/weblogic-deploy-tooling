This general-purpose config directory can be used with the WDT_CUSTOM_CONFIG environment variable
to allow tests to find variable injectors, targets, etc.
This should mirror the configuration under lib in a typical WDT install.
Do not add model-variable-injector.json or model-filters.json, since those will change default behavior.
