## The Create Domain Tool

The Create Domain Tool uses a model and WLST offline to create a domain.  To use the tool, at a minimum, the model must specify the domain's administrative password in the `domainInfo` section of the model, as shown below.

```yaml
domainInfo:
    AdminPassword: welcome1
```

Using the model above, simply run the `createDomain` tool, specifying the type of domain to create and where to create it.

    weblogic-deploy\bin\createDomain.cmd -oracle_home c:\wls12213 -domain_type WLS -domain_parent d:\demo\domains -model_file MinimalDemoDomain.yaml

Clearly, creating an empty domain with only the template-defined servers is not very interesting, but this example just reinforces how sparse the model can be.  When running the Create Domain Tool, the model must be provided either inside the archive file or as a standalone file.  If both the archive and model files are provided, the model file outside the archive will take precedence over any that might be inside the archive.  If the archive file is not provided, the Create Domain Tool will create the `topology` section only (using the `domainInfo` section) of the model in the domain.  This is because the `resources` and `appDeployments` sections of the model can reference files from the archive so to create the domain with the model-defined resources and applications, an archive file must be provided--even if the model does not reference anything in the archive.  At some point in the future, this restriction may be relaxed to require the archive only if it is actually needed.

The Create Domain Tool understands three domain types: `WLS`, `RestrictedJRF`, and `JRF`.  When specifying the domain type, the Oracle Home must match the requirements for the domain type.  Both `RestrictedJRF` and `JRF` require an Oracle Home with the FMW Infrastucture (also known as JRF) installed.  When creating a JRF domain, the RCU database information must be provided as arguments to the `createDomain` script.  Note that the tool will prompt for any passwords required.  Optionally, they can be piped to standard input (for example, `stdin`) of the script, to make the script run without user input.  For example, the command to create a JRF domain looks like the one below.  Note that this requires the user to have run RCU prior to running the command.

    weblogic-deploy\bin\createDomain.cmd -oracle_home c:\jrf12213 -domain_type JRF -domain_parent d:\demo\domains -model_file DemoDomain.yaml -rcu_db mydb.example.com:1539/PDBORCL -rcu_prefix DEMO

To have the Create Domain Tool run RCU, simply add the `-run_rcu` argument to the previous command line and the RCU schemas will be automatically created.  Be aware that when the tool runs RCU, it will automatically drop any conflicting schemas that already exist with the same RCU prefix prior to creating the new schemas!

It is also possible to specify the connection information in the model instead of using the command-line arguments.  This is especially easier for databases that require complex database connection string and extra parameters, such as RAC or Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing Cloud Service database.  For information on how to use it, refer to [Specifying RCU connection information in the model](rcuinfo.md)

To create more complex domains, it may be necessary to create a custom domain type. This is useful for cases where the domain has custom templates, or templates for other Oracle products. For more information, refer to [Domain Type Definitions](type_def.md).

### Using an Encrypted Model

If the model or variables file contains encrypted passwords, add the `-use_encryption` flag to the command line to tell the Create Domain Tool that encryption is being used and to prompt for the encryption passphrase.  As with the database passwords, the tool can also read the passphrase from standard input (for example, `stdin`) to allow the tool to run without any user input.

### Using Multiple Models

The Create Domain Tool supports the use of multiple models, as described in [Using Multiple Models](../README.md#using-multiple-models).
