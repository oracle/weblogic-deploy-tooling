# Model Samples

These sample WDT domain models are provided as a starting point for creating your own working models. They include the most commonly used sub-folders and attributes. 

You can use the [Model Help Tool](../model_help.md) to determine the complete list of sub-folders and attributes that can be used in a specific model location. For example, this command will list the attributes and sub-folders for the `JDBCSystemResource/JdbcResource` folder:
```yaml
${WDT_HOME}/bin/modelHelp.sh -oracle_home /tmp/oracle resources:/JDBCSystemResource/JdbcResource
```
