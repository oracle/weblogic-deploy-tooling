### Changes in Release 3.0.1
- [Major New Features](#major-new-features)
- [Other Changes](#other-changes)
- [Bugs Fixes](#bug-fixes)
- [Known Issues](#known-issues)


#### Major New Features
None

#### Other Changes
None

#### Bug Fixes
- #1396: Added additional validation to the `RCUDbInfo` section.
- #1388: Corrected a bug introduced in 3.0.0 that broke validation of sparse models with dynamic clusters.

#### Known Issues
1. When running `discoverDomain` with the `-remote` flag, there are several MBeans that are not being properly handled that
   will result in `INFO` level messages that look similar to the example shown below.  These errors seem to happen only when the MBean is
   non-existent so the resulting model should still be accurate.  These issues are expected to be fixed in a future release.
