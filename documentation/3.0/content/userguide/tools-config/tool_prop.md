 You can configure or tune WebLogic Deploy Tooling tools using the tool property file. This property file is installed as `<weblogic-deploy>/lib/tool.properties`. You may change the value of any of the properties in this file to tune the WDT tool. Another option is to configure the tool properties in a Custom Configuration directory. Create the `tool.properties` file in the `$WDT_CUSTOM_CONFIG` directory.

 If a property is removed from the file, or a property value is incorrectly formatted, a `WARNING` message is logged and an internal default value used instead of the missing or bad value.

 | Property                         | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
 |----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | `connect.timeout`                | The number of milliseconds that WLST waits for the online `connect` command to complete. A value of 0 means the operation will not timeout.                             |
 | `activate.timeout`               | The number of milliseconds that WLST waits for the activation of configuration changes to complete. A value of -1 means the operation will not timeout.                 |
 | `deploy.timeout`                 | The number of milliseconds that WLST waits for the undeployment process to complete. A value of 0 means the operation will not timeout.                                 |
 | `redeploy.timeout`               | The number of milliseconds that WLST waits for the redeployment process to complete. A value of 0 means the operation will not timeout.                                 |
 | `undeploy.timeout`               | The number of milliseconds that WLST waits for the undeployment process to complete. A value of 0 means the operation will not timeout.                                 |
 | `start.application.timeout`      | The number of milliseconds that WLST waits for the start application process to complete. A value of 0 means the operation will not timeout.                            |
 | `stop.application.timeout`       | The number of milliseconds that WLST waits for the stop application process to complete. A value of 0 means the operation will not timeout.                             |
 | `set.server.groups.timeout`      | Specifies the amount of time the set server groups connection can be inactive before the connection times out.                                                          |
 | `wlst.edit.lock.acquire.timeout` | Specifies the amount of time in milliseconds the WLST online `startEdit` command will wait trying to acquire the edit lock before it times out.                         |
 | `wlst.edit.lock.release.timeout` | Specifies the amount of time in milliseconds the WLST online `startEdit` command will wait for the edit lock to be released before releasing it automatically.          |
 | `wlst.edit.lock.exclusive`       | Specifies whether the edit lock acquired by `startEdit` should be exclusive or shared (default is shared).                                                              |
 | `yaml.max.file.size`             | The maximum size of the YAML model file that the WDT SnakeYAML parser will allow.  The default value of '0' uses the SnakeYAML default setting of 3145728 (i.e., 3 MB). |
 | `use.deprecation.exit.code`      | Whether deprecation messages should cause WDT tools to exit with a non-zero exit code (default is false).                                                               |
 | `disable.rcu.drop.schema`        | Whether the RCU drop step should be skipped when running Create Domain with the `-run_rco` switch (default is false).                                                   |

 You can override the value of a single property using a Java System property with the name `wdt.config.<tool-property-name>`.
 For example, adding `-Dwdt.config.connect.timeout=5000` will set the effective `connect.timeout` property to 5000 milliseconds, regardless of what the value in the tool.properties file might be.  To pass
 one or more of these properties to a WDT shell script (e.g., `createDomain.sh`), simply set the WLSDEPLOY_PROPERTIES environment variable prior to calling the shell script.  For example:
 
```shell
WLSDEPLOY_PROPERTIES="-Dwdt.config.connect.timeout=5000 -Dwdt.config.disable.rcu.drop.schema=true"
export WLSDEPLOY_PROPERTIES
$WLSDEPLOY_HOME/bin/createDomain.sh ...
```
