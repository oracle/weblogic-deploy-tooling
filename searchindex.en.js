    "content": "Administration Server configuration The Create Domain Tool lets you configure the Administration Server using a domain model. These examples show how some common configurations can be represented in the model.\nUsing the default Administration Server configuration When the Create Domain Tool is run, the templates associated with your domain type will automatically create an Administration Server named AdminServer, with default values for all the attributes. If you don’t need to change any of these attributes, such as ListenAddress or ListenPort, or any of the sub-folders, such as SSL or ServerStart, nothing needs to be added to the model.\nCustomizing the Administration Server configuration To customize the configuration of the default Administration Server, you will need to add a server with the default name AdminServer. Because you are not changing the name of the Administration Server, there is no need to specify the AdminServerName attribute under the topology section. This example shows some attributes and sub-folders:\ntopology: Server: AdminServer: ListenPort: 9071 RestartDelaySeconds: 10 ListenAddress: my-host-1 Log: FileCount: 9 LogFileSeverity: Info FileMinSize: 5000 SSL: HostnameVerificationIgnored: true JSSEEnabled: true ListenPort: 9072 Enabled: true The most common problem with this type of configuration is to misspell the name of the folder under Server, when it should be AdminServer. This will result in the creation of an Administration Server with the default name, and an additional Managed Server with the misspelled name.\nConfiguring the Administration Server with a different name If you want the Administration Server to have a name other than the default AdminServer, you will need to specify that name in the AdminServerName attribute, and use that name in the Server section. This example uses the name my-admin-server:\ntopology: AdminServerName: my-admin-server Server: 'my-admin-server': ListenPort: 9071 RestartDelaySeconds: 10 ListenAddress: my-host-1 Log: FileCount: 9 LogFileSeverity: Info FileMinSize: 5000 SSL: HostnameVerificationIgnored: true JSSEEnabled: true ListenPort: 9072 Enabled: true The most common problem with this type of configuration is to mismatch the AdminServerName attribute with the name in the Server folder. This will change the name of the default Administration Server to the value of AdminServerName, and the folder under Server to be created as an additional Managed Server.\nThe name of the Administration Server cannot be changed after domain creation, so any changes to the AdminServerName attribute will be ignored by the Update Domain Tool.",

    "content": "WebLogic Deploy Tooling supports the use of model filters to manipulate the domain model. The Create Domain, Update Domain, and Deploy Applications Tools apply filters to the model after it is read, before it is validated and applied to the domain. The Discover Domain Tool applies filters to the model after it has been discovered, before the model is validated and written.\nModel filters are written in Jython, and must be compatible with the version used in the corresponding version of WLST. A filter must implement the method filter_model(model), which accepts as a single argument the domain model as a Jython dictionary. This method can make any adjustments to the domain model that are required. Filters can be stored in any directory, as long as they can be accessed by WebLogic Deploy Tooling.\nThe following filter example (fix-password.py) sets the password for two attributes in the SecurityConfiguration WLST folder.\ndef filter_model(model): if model and 'topology' in model: if 'SecurityConfiguration' in model['topology']: model['topology']['SecurityConfiguration']['CredentialEncrypted'] = 'welcome1' model['topology']['SecurityConfiguration']['NodeManagerPasswordEncrypted'] = 'welcome1' print 'Replaced SecurityConfiguration password' else: print 'SecurityConfiguration not in the model' Model filters are configured by creating a model_filters.json file in the WLSDEPLOY_HOME/lib directory. This file has separate sections for filters to be applied for specific tools.\nAnother option is to configure model filters in a Custom configuration directory. Create the model_filters.json file in the $WDT_CUSTOM_CONFIG directory.\nThis example configures two filters for the Create Domain Tool: fix-password.py and no-mail.py, and one filter for the Discover Domain tool.\n{ \"create\": [ { \"name\": \"fixPassword\", \"path\": \"/home/user/fix-password.py\" }, { \"name\": \"noMail\", \"path\": \"/home/user/no-mail.py\" } ], \"deploy\": [ ], \"discover\": [ { \"name\": \"noMail\", \"path\": \"/home/user/no-mail.py\" } ], \"update\": [ ] } Internal Filters Internal filters are provided by WebLogic Deploy Tooling to perform modifications to the domain model. They are referenced by ID in the target configuration file. This example shows the use of the internal filter wko_filter and a user-defined filter fix-password for use with the Create Domain Tool.\n{ \"create\": [ { \"name\": \"fixPassword\", \"path\": \"/home/user/fix-password.py\" }, { \"id\": \"wko_filter\" } ] } Internal filters cannot be copied or modified like other types of filters.\nInternal filter wko_filter This filter prepares the domain model for use with WebLogic Kubernetes Operator.

    "content": "WebLogic Deploy Tooling supports online operations against running WebLogic Server-based domains. By definition, this means that WDT is acting as a remote client to the domain’s admin server–even if the WDT tool is running on the same machine as the admin server. The main point being that WDT and the server may or may not be using the same Oracle Home. This becomes an even more likely scenario when using the -remote option or when using SSH-based remote access. This document describes the general behavior you should expect when running WDT tools in online mode.\nClient and server Oracle Home version skew WDT tools work best when WDT and WebLogic Server are running the same WebLogic Server version and patch levels. Because WDT uses WLST under the covers, some operations may not work properly when the effective WebLogic Server versions are not aligned. Prior to WDT 4.0, WDT tools use the local Oracle Home’s WebLogic Server version to load its aliases (that is, knowledge base). This means that in scenarios where WDT is using an older WebLogic Server version than the running admin server, WDT would not have knowledge of or access to new configuration folders or attributes on the server. For example, the Discover Domain Tool would simply skip over folders and attributes on the server than were not present in the older WebLogic Server version being used by the WDT tool. While this allowed some operations to complete without any errors or warnings, the results are potentially incomplete or inaccurate.\nStarting in WDT 4.0 with the introduction of SSH-based remote online operations, WDT now attempts to determine the server version and patch level at tool startup. If successful, WDT initializes the aliases using the server’s version instead of the version being used to run WDT. This strategy allows WDT to access and use folders and attributes available on the server. For example, the Discover Domain tool can discover attributes on the server that may not exist in the WebLogic Server version being used to run the tool. However, this strategy also exposes WDT to version-skew related issues, such as an MBean on the server that is not available in the WebLogic Server version being used by the WDT tool. For example, the Discover Domain tool may now generate warnings like the one shown here.\n1. WLSDPLY-06140: Unable to cd to the expected path /RemoteConsoleHelper/mydomain constructed from location context model_folders = ['RemoteConsoleHelper'], 'name_tokens' = {'REMOTECONSOLEHELPER': 'mydomain','DOMAIN': 'mydomain'}; the current folder and its sub-folders cannot be discovered: cd(/RemoteConsoleHelper/mydomain) in online mode failed: Error cding to the MBean Prior to WDT 4.0, this error should not have occurred because WDT was unaware of the RemoteConsoleHelper MBean, which didn’t exist in the WebLogic Server version being used to run the tool. Discover Domain would simply have silently skipped the discovery of this MBean and its configuration, resulting in an incomplete model. With WDT 4.0, Discover Domain will no longer silently skip server configuration and will warn you when it is unable to discover some aspects of the server’s configuration. To rectify these warnings, simply make sure that WDT is using the same WebLogic Server version and patch level as the running server.\nDomain name and home directory Prior to WDT 4.0, online operations generally required the user to specify the path to the domain home directory. Starting in WDT 4.0, online operations no longer require the user to specify the domain home directory. Both the domain name and home directory are determined using WLST online to interrogate the admin server to get the actual value from the running server. Any attempt to provide the -domain_home parameter to an online operation will result in a notification message upon tool completion to let you know that the parameter was not used.",

    "content": "WDT 4.0 introduces the ability to perform online operations remotely using SSH to provide access to the remote server’s file system. SSH support is provided by the SSHJ Java library and is integrated in a way intended to support a both user/password-based and private/public key-based authentication, a wide variety of key encryption formats, and a reasonable set of defaults to minimize the number of inputs required for typical usage scenarios.\nSSH prerequisites WDT does not attempt to configure SSH between the machines. As such, you must ensure that SSH is working between the machines in question and have made an initial SSH connection outside WDT as the user that WDT will use. This ensures that any necessary SSH configuration files (for example, the known_hosts file on the client and the authorized_keys file on the server) are properly initialized to allow the SSH connection between the machines to be established.\nSSH verification The Verify SSH Tool will allow the user to verify that SSH is working properly for use by WDT. For example, to verify that SSH is working for the current OS user with public/private key authentication using the standard RSA keys, simply run the command shown here.\n% verifySSH.sh -oracle_home $MW_HOME -ssh_host windows-host.mytenancy.oraclevcn.com ...

    "content": "The archive file is used to deploy binaries and other file resources to the target domain. The archive is a ZIP file with a specific directory structure. Any file resources referenced in the model that are not already on the target system must be stored in the correct location in the archive, and the model must reflect the path into the archive.\nNote that file resources that already exist on the target system need not be included in the archive, provided that the model specifies the correct location on the target system.\nContents Example Archive structure Using multiple archive files Example This example shows an application with a SourcePath value referencing an EAR file resource contained in the archive.\nappDeployments: Application: simpleear: SourcePath: wlsdeploy/applications/simpleear.ear Target: my-cluster ModuleType: ear The example shows the attribute SourcePath of the simpleear application with a value of wlsdeploy/applications/simpleear.ear. The prefix wlsdeploy/ indicates that the resource is located in the archive file in the specified location, and will be deployed to that directory in the domain, in this case \u003cdomain-home\u003e/wlsdeploy/applications/simpleear.ear.\nArchive structure These are the paths within the archive that are used for different types of resources. You can create further directory structures underneath some of these locations to organize the files and directories as you see fit. The Archive Helper Tool makes it easy to add, update, and remove entries from the archive file.\nWhy are there two separate directory structures? Starting in WDT 4.0, some types previously stored under the top-level wlsdeploy directory have been moved to the config/wlsdeploy directory. Anything stored in the archive under a location that begins with config/wlsdeploy will end up inside the $DOMAIN_HOME/config/wlsdeploy directory. This allows the files to benefit from standard WebLogic Server behavior:\nThe pack tool will include these files in the managed server template so that managed server directories created with the unpack tools will contain these files. On managed server startup, WebLogic Server will replicate any new/changed/removed files from the Administration Server to the managed server. Because this file replication happens during managed server startup, that means placing very large files that are updated under this location can slow down managed server startup times. Most file types placed in this new config/wlsdeploy location are, by definition, small; for example, database wallets generally contain small text files like tnsnames.ora and small binary files like keystore.jks. The custom type is the only one that requires some thought and allows the user to choose between the config/wlsdeploy/custom and wlsdeploy/custom locations.\nThe config/wlsdeploy/custom location allows the file or directory to be replicated to all managed servers. This is ideal for situations like handling files that live outside an application or dynamically deploying custom security provider-related JAR files, which tend to be not be updated frequently. The wlsdeploy/custom location does not support replication of the contents. This is ideal for storing large files that do not need to be included in pack-created templates or to be replicated to the managed servers, such as when deploying in Kubernetes with WebLogic Kubernetes Operator. config/wlsdeploy/coherence The root directory under which Coherence config files and/or empty directories for Coherence persistent stores.\nconfig/wlsdeploy/config The directory where a MIME mapping property file can be stored.\nconfig/wlsdeploy/custom This is the root directory where your custom files and directories can be stored and extracted from the archive. These files are not collected by the Discover Domain Tool. Every file resource under this directory is extracted during createDomain, updateDomain, and deployApps.\nSome custom files may belong in wlsdeploy/custom. To determine which location is preferable for your files, see Why are there two separate directory structures? .\nThis location is particularly useful when handling files that live outside an application; for example, a property file used to configure the application. The general steps to make applications that use such files work when provisioning them with WDT are:\nPlace the file in the required location inside the config/wlsdeploy/custom folder inside the archive; for example, config/wlsdeploy/custom/com/mycompany/myapp/myapp-config.properties. Make sure the application is locating the file by CLASSPATH; for example, using ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream(\"com/mycompany/myapp/myapp-config.properties\"). Make sure that the server’s CLASSPATH includes the $DOMAIN_HOME/config/wlsdeploy/custom directory. One way to achieve this would be to add a setUserOverrides.sh that includes this directory in the PRE_CLASSPATH environment variable to the wlsdeploy/domainBin location in the archive file. Don’t forget to add setUserOverrides.sh to the domainInfo/domainBin of the model so that it gets extracted. config/wlsdeploy/dbWallets/\u003cwallet-name\u003e The directory where named database wallets can be stored for use with the Oracle database. The rcu name is used as the default location to store a wallet for RCU data sources. The wallet placed into the archive can be either a ZIP file or a set of one or more files. If it is a ZIP file, that ZIP file will be expanded in place when running WDT tools like the Create Domain or Update Domain tools.\nconfig/wlsdeploy/jms/foreignServer/\u003cjms-foreign-server-name\u003e The directory under which a JMS Foreign Server binding file is stored.\nconfig/wlsdeploy/nodeManager The root directory under which Node Manager keystore files are stored.\nconfig/wlsdeploy/scripts The root directory under which script files are stored. These can include JDBC create scripts and WLDF action scripts.\nconfig/wlsdeploy/servers/\u003cserver-name\u003e The root directory under which server keystore files are stored. These are organized by server name, such as config/wlsdeploy/servers/AdminServer/mykey.jks.\nconfig/wlsdeploy/serverTemplates/\u003cserver-template-name\u003e The root directory under which server template keystore files are stored. These are organized by server template name, such as config/wlsdeploy/serverTemplates/myServerTemplate/mykey.jks.\nwlsdeploy/applications The root directory under which applications and their deployment plans are stored. Applications can be stored in the archive as EAR, WAR, or JAR files, or as an exploded directory at this location.\nA sample expanded WAR application might have these entries:\nwlsdeploy/applications/myApp/index.jsp wlsdeploy/applications/myApp/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF wlsdeploy/applications/myApp/WEB-INF/classes/MyClass.class wlsdeploy/applications/myApp/WEB-INF/web.xml wlsdeploy/applications/myApp/WEB-INF/weblogic.xml wlsdeploy/classpathLibraries The root directory under which JARs/directories used for server classpaths are stored. Every file resource under this directory is extracted, even those not referenced in the model.\nwlsdeploy/custom This is the root directory where your custom files and directories can be stored and extracted from the archive. These files are not collected by the Discover Domain Tool. Every file resource under this directory is extracted during createDomain, updateDomain, and deployApps.\nSome custom files may belong in config/wlsdeploy/custom. To determine which location is preferable for your files, see Why are there two separate directory structures? .\nwlsdeploy/domainBin The root directory under which $DOMAIN_HOME/bin scripts are stored. Only scripts referenced in the domainInfo/domainBin section of the model are extracted, as shown in the example.\ndomainInfo: domainBin: - wlsdeploy/domainBin/setUserOverrides.sh wlsdeploy/domainLibraries The root directory under which $DOMAIN_HOME/lib libraries are stored. Domain libraries must be stored as JAR files. Only libraries referenced in the domainInfo/domainLibraries section of the model are extracted, as shown in the example.\ndomainInfo: domainLibraries: - wlsdeploy/domainLibraries/myLibrary.jar wlsdeploy/opsswallet The directory where a wallet can be stored for use with Oracle Platform Security Services. The wallet placed into the archive can be either a ZIP file or a set of one or more files. If it is a ZIP file, that ZIP file will be expanded in place when running WDT tools like the Create Domain or Update Domain tools.\nwlsdeploy/pluginDeployments The root directory under which plugin deployments are stored. Plugin deployments can be stored in the archive as JAR files, or as an exploded directory at this location.\nwlsdeploy/security/saml2 The directory under which SAML2 partner data initialization files can be stored for use with the SAML2 Identity Asserter. These files can include saml2idppartner.properties and saml2sppartner.properties, and any XML metadata files they reference.\nIf these files exist in the domain’s $DOMAIN_HOME/security directory, then the Discover Domain Tool will add them to the archive. However, the Discover Domain Tool will never try to export the SAML2 partner data or generate the properties files needed to load the exported SAML2 partner data into WebLogic Server.\nBoth the Create Domain and Update Domain Tools will extract these files from the archive and place them into the target domain’s $DOMAIN_HOME/security directory, if they exist in the archive. No model references are required.\nNote that server will not load the SAML2 partner data files if a corresponding \u003cfilename\u003e.initialized file is present in the domain’s $DOMAIN_HOME/security directory. This indicates that existing data files have already been processed. To force the server to reload a SAML2 partner data file, remove the corresponding \u003cfilename\u003e.initialized file, and restart the server to reinitialize the SAML2 partner data.\nNote that this functionality is only present starting in the October 2023 PSUs for WebLogic Server 12.2.1.4 and 14.1.1, and future versions of WebLogic Server.\nwlsdeploy/security/xacmlPolicies The directory under which XACML Authorizer policies can be stored when defining policies directly in XACML. The name of the policy file should match the name of the policy in the model. For example, the following model entry requires that the XACML policy file be stored in the archive at wlsdeploy/security/xacmlPolicies/MyQueueSendPolicy.xml.\nMyQueueSendPolicy: ResourceID: 'type=\u003cjms\u003e, application=MyJmsModule, destinationType=queue, resource=MyQueue, action=send' XacmlDocument: wlsdeploy/security/xacmlPolicies/MyQueueSendPolicy.xml XacmlStatus: 3 wlsdeploy/security/xacmlRoles The directory under which XACML Role Mapper role definitions can be stored when defining role directly in XACML. The name of the role file should match the name of the role in the model. For example, the following model entry requires that the XACML role definition file be stored in the archive at wlsdeploy/security/xacmlRoles/users.xml.\nusers: XacmlDocument: wlsdeploy/security/xacmlRoles/users.xml XacmlStatus: 3 wlsdeploy/sharedLibraries The root directory under which shared libraries and their deployment plans are stored. Shared libraries can be stored in the archive as EAR, WAR, or JAR files, or as an exploded directory at this location.\nwlsdeploy/stores The root directory under which empty directories must exist for FileStore elements in the model.\nwlsdeploy/structuredApplications The root directory under which “structured” applications are stored; the WebLogic Server documentation refers to them as application installation directories . Applications inside the specified directory structure can be stored in the archive as EAR or WAR files, or as an exploded directory.\nA sample “structured” application might have these entries:\nwlsdeploy/structuredApplications/myApp/app/webapp.war wlsdeploy/structuredApplications/myApp/plan/plan.xml wlsdeploy/structuredApplications/myApp/plan/WEB-INF/weblogic.xml wlsdeploy/structuredApplications/myApp/plan/AppFileOverrides/updated.properties wlsdeploy/wrcExtension The directory into which the WebLogic Remote Console extension WAR file (i.e., console-rest-ext-6.0.war) is stored. Create Domain, Update Domain, and Deploy Applications tools place any file in this directory into the $DOMAIN_HOME/management-services-ext/ directory. NOTE: The Deploy Applications Tool is deprecated in WDT 4.0.0.\nUsing multiple archive files The Create Domain, Update Domain, Deploy Applications, and Validate Model Tools allow the specification of multiple archive files on the command line. For example:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\createDomain.cmd -archive_file one.zip,two.zip,three.zip ... File resources can be present in any of these archives. Resources in each archive will supersede resources found in previous archives.\nWhen the model references a resource that is present in multiple archives, the latest in the list takes precedence. For example, if the model references wlsdeploy/applications/myapp.ear, and that resource is present in archives one.zip and two.zip, the resource in two.zip will be used.\nResources that are extracted without being referenced directly are extracted from the archives in the order specified in the archive_file argument. For example, if one.zip and two.zip have resources under wlsdeploy/classpathLibraries, the resources in one.zip will be extracted to \u003cdomain-home\u003e/wlsdeploy/classpathLibraries, then the resources of two.zip will be extracted to the same location, overwriting any overlapping files.",

Let’s look at an example.\nThe following model section uses model tokens for a JDBC DataSource URL, user name, and password.\nresources: JDBCSystemResource: MyDatabase: Target: mycluster JdbcResource: DatasourceType: GENERIC JDBCConnectionPoolParams: ConnectionReserveTimeoutSeconds: 10 InitialCapacity: 0 MaxCapacity: 5 MinCapacity: 0 TestConnectionsOnReserve: true TestTableName: SQL ISVALID JDBCDriverParams: DriverName: oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver PasswordEncrypted: '@@PROP:JDBCSystemResource.MyDatabase.JdbcResource.JDBCDriverParams.PasswordEncrypted@@' URL: '@@PROP:JDBCSystemResource.MyDatabase.JdbcResource.JDBCDriverParams.URL@@' Properties: user: Value: '@@PROP:JDBCSystemResource.MyDatabase.JdbcResource.JDBCDriverParams.Properties.user.Value@@' The following variable file specifies the values that will be substituted for each token.\nJDBCSystemResource.MyDatabase.JdbcResource.JDBCDriverParams.URL=jdbc:oracle:thin:@//mydb.example.com:1539/PDBORCL JDBCSystemResource.MyDatabase.JdbcResource.JDBCDriverParams.Properties.user.Value=scott JDBCSystemResource.MyDatabase.JdbcResource.JDBCDriverParams.PasswordEncrypted=tiger The following command-line supplies the variable file to enable token resolution while creating the domain.\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\createDomain.cmd -model_file mymodel.yaml -variable_file myvariables.properties -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -domain_parent d:\\demo\\domains Domain types By default, the Create Domain Tool, like all other WDT tools, assumes that the domain being created is a pure WebLogic Server domain. What it means to be a WebLogic Server domain is defined by the WLS typedef file, located at weblogic-deploy/lib/typedefs/WLS.json. Other domain types are known simply by having the corresponding typedef file installed at weblogic-deploy/lib/typedefs/\u003ctype-name\u003e.json. For example, the JRF domain type is defined by the weblogic-deploy/lib/typedefs/JRF.json typedef file.\nWhen creating a domain of another type, simply add the -domain_type \u003ctype-name\u003e command-line argument; for example, for a JRF domain, add -domain_type JRF to the command-line arguments. Domain typedefs play an important role for the Create Domain Tool because they tell the tool what domain templates to apply, how to handle targeting of resources defined by the domain templates, and information about any RCU schemas that are needed. For more information, refer to Domain type definitions page.\nAn example of using the domain type argument:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\createDomain.cmd -domain_type JRF -model_file model.yaml -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -domain_parent d:\\demo\\domains Note When specifying a domain type, it is critical that the Oracle Home being referenced has the necessary products installed. For example, to create a JRF domain, the Oracle Home needs to have the FMW Infrastructure installed.\nWhen creating domains whose type relies on RCU schemas, you must create the RCU schemas in the database. This can be accomplished by either running the rcu utility installed in the Oracle Home (for example, $ORACLE_HOME/oracle_common/bin/rcu) directly or having the Create Domain Tool run RCU for you. With either approach, the domainInfo:/RCUDbInfo section is important to provide the information needed to configure the template-defined RCU data sources. The following example shows the minimal set of attributes required when the rcu utility has already been used to create the schemas.\ndomainInfo: RCUDbInfo: rcu_db_conn_string: mydb.example.com:1539/PDBORCL rcu_prefix: DEMO rcu_schema_password: my-demo-password When using the Create Domain Tool to create the RCU schemas, the rcu_admin_password attribute must also be specified. If the database administrative user is not sys as sysdba, then the rcu_admin_user attribute is used to specify the database administrative user name that should be used instead.\ndomainInfo: RCUDbInfo: rcu_db_conn_string: mydb.example.com:1539/PDBORCL rcu_prefix: DEMO rcu_admin_user: admin rcu_admin_password: my-admin-password rcu_schema_password: my-demo-password The RCUDbInfo section has other fields that may be important in more advanced scenarios. Please see the Connect to a database page for more information.\nOnce the model is properly configured for running RCU, simply add the -run_rcu argument to the Create Domain Tool command line.\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\createDomain.cmd -run_rcu -domain_type JRF -run_rcu -model_file jrf-model.yaml -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -domain_parent d:\\demo\\domains Warning When using the -run_rcu to create the RCU schemas, note that the default behavior of the Create Domain Tool is to first try to drop the schemas prior to creating them. This behavior can be disabled using the disable.rcu.drop.schema property in the tool.properties file. See the [Tool property file] (/weblogic-deploy-tooling/userguide/tools-config/tool_prop/) page for more information.\nTo create more complex domains, it may be necessary to create a custom domain type. This is useful for cases where the domain has custom templates, or templates for other Oracle products. For more information, refer to Domain type definitions .\nUser password validation By default, WLST offline requires the administrator password to have a minimum of 8 characters and a minimum of 1 numeric or special character. The Create Domain tool will validate both the domainInfo section’s AdminPassword attribute value and any Password fields for users added in the topology section’s Security/User section against the default rules.\nPrior to 3.5.0, validation errors for the administrator password resulted in a WLST error that aborted domain creation while validation errors for other users resulted in warnings from WDT even though the domain and user was created. However, due to a bug, any of these users with an invalid password were created with an unusable password.\nStarting in 3.5.0, this validation has been unified and enhanced. Now, password validation:\nHappens upfront during model validation; Logs errors for all users’ password validation errors and aborts the domain creation process; Takes into account any model settings for the WebLogic Server System Password Validator to ensure passwords follow its settings. For example, if model contains the snippet shown below, the minimum length of the passwords will be 12 instead of the default value of 8. Any attributes not present in the model will use their default values during password validation. topology: SecurityConfiguration: Realm: myrealm: PasswordValidator: SystemPasswordValidator: SystemPasswordValidator: MinPasswordLength: 12 WARNING: The MinPasswordLength attribute, whose default value is 8, and the MinNumericOrSpecialCharacters attribute, whose default value is 1, have special behavior. WLST offline does not consider these values when validating the administrator password. Instead, it always uses the default values so even if Create Domain allowed a lower value, WLST offline would fail to create the domain due to the password not meeting these default values. For this new password validation purposes only, Create Domain will use the larger value between the one specified in the model and the default value. Create Domain will still create the SystemPasswordValidator security provider with the exact settings in the model.\nThis new validation behavior can be disabled by setting the enable.create.domain.password.validation property to false in $WLSDEPLOY_HOME/lib/tool.properties or by adding -Dwdt.config.enable.create.domain.password.validation=false to the WLSDEPLOY_PROPERTIES environment variable prior to invoking the Create Domain tool. Note that disabling this validation will disable all validation of passwords except for the WLST offline validation of the domain’s administrative password.\nUsing an encrypted model If the model or variables file contains passwords encrypted with the WDT Encrypt Model Tool, you must provide the WDT encryption passphrase used to encrypt the model so that the Create Domain Tool can decrypt them. To do this, provide one of the following command-line arguments:\n-passphrase_env \u003cENV_VAR\u003e - read the passphrase from the specified environment variable, -passphrase_file \u003cfile-name\u003e - read the passphrase from a file that contains the passphrase, or -passphrase_prompt - have the tool read the passphrase from stdin, either by prompting or piping the value to the shell script’s standard input. Using multiple models The Create Domain Tool supports the use of multiple models, as described in Using multiple models .\nDevelopment domain and boot.properties When creating a development domain, WDT provides the convenience of making a boot.properties file for each of the servers in the domain. The boot.properties file will contain encrypted values of the Administration Server user name and password. When the Administration Server or Managed Server is started, WebLogic Server will bypass the prompt for credentials, and instead use the credentials from the boot.properties file.\nA domain is in production mode if the ServerStartMode option is set to either prod or secure, or if the domain MBean’s ProductionModeEnabled attribute is set to true. It is an anti-pattern to use both attributes in the same model.\nThe boot.properties file is stored in the domain home on the machine where WDT runs. It is stored for each server as \u003cdomain_home\u003e/servers/\u003cserver_name\u003e/security/boot.properties.\nThe following is a model example using ServerStartMode to specify the domain should be created in development mode. Note that this example is for illustrative purposes only since the default for a domain is development mode so that ServerStartMode line below has no effect.\ndomainInfo: AdminUserName: weblogic AdminPassword: welcome1 ServerStartMode: dev topology: Name: my-domain Environment variables The following environment variables may be set.\nJAVA_HOME The location of the JDK. This must be a valid Java 7 or later JDK. WLSDEPLOY_PROPERTIES System properties that will be passed to WLST. Warning When running the Create Domain Tool (and any other tool that use WLST), the actual JDK used to run the tool will be the JDK used to install WebLogic Server in the Oracle Home and not the one defined by the JAVA_HOME environment variable. The best practice is to set JAVA_HOME to point to the same JDK installation that was used to install WebLogic Server.\nOpening an issue against the Create Domain Tool Please provide the full console output of the tool (that is, what is printed to stdout and stderr) and the log file, createDomain.log, which is typically found in the \u003cinstall home\u003e/weblogic-deploy/logs directory. If possible, please provide the model, variable and archive files, and any other information that helps to understand the environment, what you are doing, and what is happening.\nParameter table for createDomain Parameter Definition Default -archive_file The path to the archive file to use. If the -model_file argument is not specified, the model file in this archive will be used. This can also be specified as a comma-separated list of archive files. The overlapping contents in each archive take precedence over previous archives in the list. -domain_home Required if -domain_parent is not used. The full directory and name where the domain should be created. -domain_parent Required if -domain_home is not used. The parent directory where the domain should be created. The name is the domain name in the model. -domain_type The type of domain (for example, WLS, JRF). WLS -java_home The Java home to use for the new domain. If not specified, it defaults to the value of the JAVA_HOME environment variable. -model_file The location of the model file. This can also be specified as a comma-separated list of model locations, where each successive model layers on top of the previous ones. -oracle_home Home directory of the Oracle WebLogic installation. Required if the ORACLE_HOME environment variable is not set. -opss_wallet The location of the Oracle wallet containing the domain’s encryption key required to reconnect to an existing set of RCU schemas. -opss_wallet_passphrase_env An alternative to entering the OPSS wallet passphrase at a prompt. The value is an environment variable name that WDT will use to retrieve the passphrase. -opss_wallet_passphrase_file An alternative to entering the OPSS wallet passphrase at a prompt. The value is the name of a file with a string value which WDT will read to retrieve the passphrase. -passphrase_env An alternative to entering the encryption passphrase at a prompt. The value is an environment variable name that WDT will use to retrieve the passphrase. -passphrase_file An alternative to entering the encryption passphrase at a prompt. The value is the name of a file with a string value which WDT will read to retrieve the passphrase. -passphrase_prompt Allow WDT to prompt for the encryption passphrase or read it from stdin. -run_rcu Run RCU to create the database schemas specified by the domain type using the specified RCU prefix. Running RCU will drop any existing schemas with the same RCU prefix if they exist prior to trying to create them. -use_encryption (deprecated) Replaced by the -passphrase_prompt argument. -variable_file The location of the property file containing the values for variables used in the model. This can also be specified as a comma-separated list of property files, where each successive set of properties layers on top of the previous ones.",

For pre-12.2.1 versions, the -wlst_path argument must be used to point to the product home where the appropriate WLST shell script exists; for example, for SOA 12.1.3, add -wlst_path \u003cORACLE_HOME\u003e/soa so that the tool uses the WLST shell script with the proper environment for SOA domains. In 12.2.1 and later, this is no longer necessary because the WLST shell script in the standard \u003cORACLE_HOME\u003eoracle_common/common/bin directory will automatically load all components in the Oracle Home. Using the new domain type, simply run the following command to run RCU and create the SOA domain with all of its resources and applications deployed.\nweblogic-deploy\\bin\\createDomain.cmd -oracle_home d:\\SOA12213 -domain_type SOA -domain_parent d:\\demo\\domains -model_file DemoDomain.yaml -archive_file DemoDomain.zip -variable_file DemoDomain.properties -run_rcu Custom extension templates The customExtensionTemplates attribute can be used to specify custom extension templates to be applied to the domain. These should be specified as absolute file paths, and can use tokens.\n{ \"name\": \"MyCustom\", \"description\": \"My custom type domain definitions\", \"versions\": { \"12.2.1.3\": \"My_12213\" }, \"definitions\": { \"My_12213\": { \"baseTemplate\": \"Basic WebLogic Server Domain\", \"extensionTemplates\": [ ], \"customExtensionTemplates\": [ \"/user/me/templates/my-template.jar\", \"@@ORACLE_HOME@@/user_templates/other-template.jar\" ], \"serverGroupsToTarget\": [ \"MY-MAN-SVR\" ], \"rcuSchemas\": [ ] } } } If there are any server groups in the custom template that should be targeted to managed servers, they should be specified in the serverGroupsToTarget attribute, similar to MY_MAN_SVR in the example above.\nUsing compact profile The topologyProfile field can be used to create a domain using a specific profile for each of the templates. This partial example will apply the compact profile for each of the specified templates.\n{ \"copyright\": \"Copyright (c) 2022, Oracle Corporation and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.\", \"license\": \"Licensed under the Universal Permissive License v 1.0 as shown at https://oss.oracle.com/licenses/upl\", \"name\": \"JRF-Compact\", \"description\": \"JRF type domain with a compact profile definitions\", \"topologyProfile\": \"Compact\", ... } WebLogic Deploy Tooling provides the JRF-Compact.json type definition file that can be used to create a JRF domain using the compact profile.\nTargeting in earlier WebLogic Server versions Templates in WebLogic Server versions prior to 12.2.1 may require the use of the applyJRF WLST command to correctly target resources to the correct clusters and servers. The default behavior for WebLogic Deploy Tooling is to invoke applyJRF only when the extensionTemplates list includes JRF templates.\nA custom type definition file can require applyJRF to be invoked after the templates are added. This is done by setting the targeting attribute to APPLY_JRF, as in this example:\n{ \"name\": \"MyCustom\", \"description\": \"My custom type domain definitions\", \"versions\": { \"10.3.6\": \"My_11G\" }, \"definitions\": { \"My_11G\": { \"baseTemplate\": \"@@WL_HOME@@/common/templates/wls/wls.jar\", \"extensionTemplates\": [ \"/user/me/templates/my-template.jar\" ], \"targeting\": \"APPLY_JRF\", \"serverGroupsToTarget\": [ \"MY-MAN-SVR\" ], \"rcuSchemas\": [ ] } } } The targeting attribute is not valid for WebLogic Server versions 12.2.1 and later.\nUsing the typedef file to exclude template installed resources from the model and archive The Discover Domain Tool attempts to provide a sparse model by employing strategies such as not including attributes that are default values. It is important to not install template resources through the model. First, the templates will install the same resources in the target domain. Second, if you install resources from a on-premises domain into a target domain that is a later WebLogic version, it could cause conflicts. The Discover Domain Tool uses the discover-filters section of the typedef file to filter out discovered objects and exclude them from the model and archive files.\nThe list contains an entry for each type of resource to exclude, along with a list of names or regular expressions that are used to match the name of the specified type to exclude.\nThe following example is the discover-filters list in the JRF.json typedef file. Note that the key is the model name starting from the top-level folder (and excluding the grouping construct names topology, resources, and appDeployments).\n\"discover-filters\": { \"/Application\": [ \"^coherence-transaction-rar$\", \"^DMS Application.*\", \"^em$\", \"^FMW Welcome Page Application.*\", \"^opss-rest$\", \"^state-management-provider-memory-rar.*\", \"^wsil-wls.*\", \"^wsm-pm$\" ], \"/CoherenceClusterSystemResource\": [ \"^defaultCoherenceCluster$\" ], \"/JDBCSystemResource\": [ \".*LocalSvcTblDataSource$\", \".*mds-owsm$\", \".*opss-audit-DBDS$\", \".*opss-audit-viewDS$\", \".*opss-data-source$\", \".*opss-ds$\", \".*WLSSchemaDataSource$\" ], \"/FileStore\": [ \"^JRFWSAsyncFileStore$\", \"^mds-owsm$\" ], \"/JMSSystemResource\": [ \"^JRFWSAsyncJmsModule$\" ], \"/JMSServer\": [ \"^JRFWSAsyncJmsServer$\" ], \"/Library\": [ \"^adf\\\\.oracle\\\\.businesseditor.*\", \"^adf\\\\.oracle\\\\.domain.*\", \"^adf\\\\.oracle\\\\.domain\\\\.webapp.*\", \"^em_common.*\", \"^em_core_ppc_pojo_jar$\", \"^em_error.*\", \"^em_sdkcore_ppc_public_pojo_jar$\", \"^emagentsdk_jar.*\", \"^emagentsdkimpl_jar.*\", \"^emagentsdkimplpriv_jar.*\", \"^emas$\", \"^emcore$\", \"^emcore_jar$\", \"^emcoreclient_jar$\", \"^emcorecommon_jar$\", \"^emcoreconsole_jar$\", \"^emcoreintsdk_jar.*\", \"^emcorepbs_jar$\", \"^emcoresdk_jar.*\", \"^emcoresdkimpl_jar.*\", \"^jsf.*\", \"^jstl.*\", \"^log4j_jar.*\", \"^odl\\\\.clickhistory.*\", \"^odl\\\\.clickhistory\\\\.webapp.*\", \"^ohw-rcf.*\", \"^ohw-uix.*\", \"^oracle\\\\.adf\\\\.dconfigbeans.*\", \"^oracle\\\\.adf\\\\.desktopintegration.*\", \"^oracle\\\\.adf\\\\.desktopintegration\\\\.model.*\", \"^oracle\\\\.adf\\\\.management.*\", \"^oracle\\\\.bi\\\\.adf\\\\.model\\\\.slib.*\", \"^oracle\\\\.bi\\\\.adf\\\\.view\\\\.slib.*\", \"^oracle\\\\.bi\\\\.adf\\\\.webcenter\\\\.slib.*\", \"^oracle\\\\.bi\\\\.composer.*\", \"^oracle\\\\.bi\\\\.jbips.*\", \"^oracle\\\\.dconfig-infra.*\", \"^oracle\\\\.jrf\\\\.system\\\\.filter$\", \"^oracle\\\\.jsp\\\\.next.*\", \"^oracle\\\\.pwdgen.*\", \"^oracle\\\\.sdp\\\\.client.*\", \"^oracle\\\\.sdp\\\\.messaging.*\", \"^oracle\\\\.webcenter\\\\.composer.*\", \"^oracle\\\\.webcenter\\\\.skin.*\", \"^oracle\\\\.wsm\\\\.console.*\", \"^oracle\\\\.wsm\\\\.idmrest.*\", \"^oracle\\\\.wsm\\\\.seedpolicies.*\", \"^orai18n-adf.*\", \"^owasp\\\\.esapi.*\", \"^UIX.*\" ], \"/ShutdownClass\": [ \"^DMSShutdown$\", \"^JOC-Shutdown$\" ], \"/StartupClass\": [ \"^JMX Framework Startup Class$\", \"^JOC-Startup$\", \"^JPS Startup Class$\", \"^JPS Startup Post-Activation Class$\", \"^WSM Startup Class$\", \"^Web Services Startup Class$\", \"^JRF Startup Class$\", \"^ODL-Startup$\", \"^DMS-Startup$\", \"^AWT Application Context Startup Class$\" ], \"/WLDFSystemResource\": [ \"^Module-FMWDFW$\" ] } This mechanism also supports other named top-level fields; for example, /JDBCStore and /MailSession.

The Creator class provides base methods to recurse through nested folders in the domain model, create or update those folders, and set or update their attributes. Each subclass can override these methods to account for variations in behavior for different functional areas.\nFor example, the SecurityProviderCreator subclass overrides the method _create_named_subtype_mbeans with special processing to remove all existing security providers, and re-create them from the data in the model.\nThe update of folders and attributes in the resources section of the domain model follows a similar pattern, but the base class for these modules is Deployer in the module wlsdeploy.tool.deploy.deployer.py.\nThe class TopologyUpdater is a special subclass of Deployer that is used to update elements in the topology section after their initial creation.",

    "content": "Contents Overview Top-level sections Simple example Model names Model tokens Model semantics Declaring named MBeans to delete Using multiple models Upgrading from WDT 1.x to WDT 2.x YAML files Overview The metadata model (or model, for short) is a version-independent description of a WebLogic Server domain configuration. The tools are designed to support a sparse model so that the model need only describe what is required for the specific operation without describing other artifacts. For example, to deploy an application that depends on a JDBC data source into an existing domain that may contain other applications or data sources, the model needs to describe only the application and the data source in question. If the data source was previously created, the deployApps tool will not try to recreate it but may update part of that data source’s configuration if the model description is different from the existing values. If the application was previously deployed, the deployApps tool will compare the binaries to determine if the application needs to be redeployed or not.\nThe model structure, and its folder and attribute names, are based on the WLST 12.2.1.3 offline structure and names with redundant folders removed to keep the model simple. For example, the WLST path to the URL for a JDBC data source is /JDBCSystemResource/\u003cdata-source-name\u003e/JdbcResource/\u003cdata-source-name\u003e/JDBCDriverParams/NO_NAME_0/URL. In the model, it is resources:/JDBCSystemResource/\u003cdata-source-name\u003e/JdbcResource/JDBCDriverParams/URL (where resources is the top-level model section where all WebLogic Server resources/services are described).\nThe model is written in YAML (or optionally, JSON). The YAML parser, based on Snake YAML, is strict with regard to the specification and is fully YAML 1.1 compliant. For example, YAML does not support tabs as indent characters so the parser will generate parse errors if the model file contains leading tabs used for indentation purposes. In general, names and values can be specified without quotes except when the content contains one of the restricted characters in a location that causes the YAML parser to consider it to be a markup character instead of text. For example, a key may contain an embedded hyphen without needing to be quoted; however, if the key starts with a hyphen, the parser may consider it to be the start of a YAML list element. See the YAML 1.1 specification for more information.\nTop-level model sections The tooling has five top-level model sections:\ndomainInfo - The location where special information not represented in WLST is specified (for example, the libraries that go in $DOMAIN_HOME/lib). topology - The location where servers, clusters, machines, server templates, and other domain-level configuration is specified. resources - The location where resources and services are specified (for example, data sources, JMS, WLDF). appDeployments - The location where shared libraries and applications are specified. kubernetes - The location where the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator domain configuration is specified. Simple example Here is a simple example of a model to deploy an application and its data source:\nresources: JDBCSystemResource: MyDataSource: Target: '@@PROP:myjcs.cluster1.name@@' JdbcResource: JDBCDataSourceParams: JNDIName: jdbc/generic1 JDBCDriverParams: DriverName: oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver URL: jdbc:oracle:thin:@//@@PROP:dbcs1.url@@ PasswordEncrypted: '@@PROP:dbcs1.password@@' Properties: user: Value: '@@PROP:dbcs1.user@@' oracle.net.CONNECT_TIMEOUT: Value: 5000 JDBCConnectionPoolParams: MaxCapacity: 50 appDeployments: Application: simpleear : SourcePath: wlsdeploy/applications/simpleear.ear Target: '@@PROP:myjcs.cluster1.name@@' ModuleType: ear Library: 'jsf#2.0': SourcePath: '@@WL_HOME@@/common/deployable-libraries/jsf-2.0.war' Target: '@@PROP:myjcs.cluster1.name@@' ModuleType: war The above example shows two important features of the framework. First, notice that the URL, PasswordEncrypted, user property Value and all Target fields contain values that have a @@PROP:\u003cname\u003e@@ pattern. This indicates a variable placeholder whose value is specified at runtime using a variables file. For more information about this and other token types, see Model tokens .\nSecond, notice that the jsf#2.0 shared library SourcePath attribute value starts with @@WL_HOME@@. This is a path token that can be used to specify that the location is relative to the location of the WebLogic Server home directory on the target environment. For more information and a list of available path tokens, see Model tokens .\nThe example above shows the attribute SourcePath of the simpleear application with a value of wlsdeploy/applications/simpleear.ear. The prefix wlsdeploy/ indicates that the resource is located in the archive file in the specified location, and will be deployed to that directory within the domain, in this case \u003cdomain-home\u003e/wlsdeploy/applications/simpleear.ear. See the Archive file for more details about using the archive file.\nUsers can create further directory structures underneath the above locations to organize the files and directories as they see fit. Note that any binary that already exists on the target system need not be included in the archive provided that the model specified the correct location on the target system.\nOne final note is that the framework is written in such a way to allow the model to be extended for use by other tools. Adding other top-level sections to the model is supported and the existing tooling and framework will simply ignore them, if present. For example, it would be possible to add a soaComposites section to the model where SOA composite applications are described, and a location within the archive file where those binaries can be stored, so that a tool that understands SOA composites and how to deploy them could be run against the same model and archive files.\nModel names The WebLogic Deploy Tooling handles names of WebLogic Server configuration artifacts in a very prescribed way. To understand how names are handled, users first need a basic understanding of WLST offline naming. In WLST offline, there are two general categories of configuration artifacts:\nArtifacts that can hold zero or more references to another configuration artifact type. Artifacts that can hold zero or one reference to another configuration artifact. For example, a domain can contain zero or more JDBCSystemResource or AppDeployment instances but can only contain a single SecurityConfiguration artifact. When working with configuration artifacts like JDBCSystemResource, the name is always modeled as a sub-element of the JDBCSystemResource element, as shown below.\nresources: JDBCSystemResource: MyDataSource: Target: mycluster ... YourDataSource: Target: yourcluster ... In the example above, the model has two instances of JDBCSystemResource: one named MyDataSource and one named YourDataSource. For anyone familiar with WLST, this should seem somewhat familiar because the WLST offline path to the MyDataSource configuration will always start with /JDBCSystemResource/MyDataSource. What might not seem familiar is that in this WLST folder, there is a Name attribute that is also set to MyDataSource. The WebLogic Deploy Tooling requires that modelers set the JDBCSystemRTesource name using the folder semantics as shown in the example. It is not possible to set the Name using the Name attribute inside the folder and any attempts to do so, will not work; in this case, the Name attribute is redundant because the name was already specified as the folder name.\nWhen working with artifacts like SecurityConfiguration or JMX, there is never more than one instance of these artifacts in a domain because they are just configuration containers and their names generally have no semantic meaning. As such, the WebLogic Deploy Tooling does not expose these names in the model, as shown below:\ntopology: SecurityConfiguration: NodeManagerUsername: weblogic NodeManagerPasswordEncrypted: welcome1 As the example above shows, the SecurityConfiguration element has no named sub-element, as there is with JDBCSystemResource, even though the WLST path to the SecurityConfiguration attributes is /SecurityConfiguration/\u003cdomain-name\u003e. The WebLogic Deploy Tooling has built-in rules and a knowledge base that controls how these names are handled so that it can complete the configuration of these artifacts. As with the previous class of configuration artifact, the folder almost always contains a Name attribute that, in WLST, could be used to change the name. As with the previous class of artifact, the WebLogic Deploy Tooling does not support the use of the Name attribute in these folders and any attempt to set the Name attribute will not be honored. In general, the only model location that uses the Name attribute is the top-level topology section, because this maps to where WLST stores the domain name.\nModel tokens The model allows the use of tokens that are substituted with text values as the model is processed. This section describes several types of tokens.\nVariable tokens are declared with the syntax @@PROP:\u003cvariable\u003e@@. This type of token represents a value that is resolved at runtime using a variables file in a standard Java properties file format. Variables can be used for any value and for some names. For example, to automate standing up an environment with one or more applications in the Oracle Java Cloud Service, service provisioning does not allow the provisioning script to specify the server names. For example, if the application being deployed immediately following provisioning needs to tweak the Server Start arguments to specify a Java system property, the model can use a variable placeholder in place of the server name and populate the variable file with the provisioned server names dynamically between provisioning and application deployment.\nFile tokens are declared with the syntax @@FILE:\u003cfilename\u003e@@. This type of token is similar to a variable token, but it references a single value that is read from the specified file. For example, the model may reference a password attribute as follows:\nPasswordEncrypted: '@@FILE:/home/me/dbcs1.txt@@' The file /home/me/dbcs1.txt would then contain this single line:\npassword#123 As the model is processed, the value for the PasswordEncrypted would resolve to password#123. It is also possible to combine file placeholders with other types of tokens, to allow for variations in the name and location of the file, such as:\nPasswordEncrypted: '@@FILE:/dir/@@PROP:name@@.txt@@' PasswordEncrypted: '@@FILE:@@ORACLE_HOME@@/dir/name.txt@@' Environment tokens are declared with the syntax @@ENV:\u003cname\u003e@@. This type of token is resolved by looking up the system environment variable \u003cname\u003e, and substituting that value for the token.\nSecret tokens are declared with the syntax @@SECRET:\u003cname\u003e:\u003ckey\u003e@@. This type of token is resolved by determining the location of a Kubernetes secret file, and reading the first line from that file. That line is substituted for the token.\nThere are two methods for deriving the location of the Kubernetes secret file. The first method involves using one or more configured root directories, and looking for the secret file in the path \u003croot-directory\u003e/\u003cname\u003e/\u003ckey\u003e.\nThe root directories are configured as a comma-separated list of directories, using the environment variable WDT_MODEL_SECRETS_DIRS. For example, if WDT_MODEL_SECRETS_DIRS is set to /etc/my-secrets,/etc/your-secrets, then the token @@SECRET:secrets:the-secret@@ will search the following locations:\n/etc/my-secrets/secrets/the-secret /etc/your-secrets/secrets/the-secret If either of these files is found, the secret is read from that file and substituted in the model.\nThe second method for locating the Kubernetes secret file is to use the environment variable WDT_MODEL_SECRETS_NAME_DIR_PAIRS to map \u003cname\u003e values to specific directory locations. For example, if WDT_MODEL_SECRETS_NAME_DIR_PAIRS is set to my-root=/etc/my-secrets,your-root=/etc/your-secrets, then the token @@SECRET:your-root:the-secret@@ will look for the secrets file at:\n/etc/your-secrets/the-secret If the \u003cname\u003e value has a corresponding mapped directory in WDT_MODEL_SECRETS_NAME_DIR_PAIRS, then that directory will take precedence over any roots specified in WDT_MODEL_SECRETS_DIRS.\nNote It is important that the secrets directories contain only secrets files, because those files are examined to create a list of available name/key pairs.\nPath tokens are tokens that reference known values, and can be used to make the model more portable. For example, a model may reference a WebLogic library source path as:\nSourcePath: '@@WL_HOME@@/common/deployable-libraries/jsf-2.0.war' Using the path token @@WL_HOME@@ allows the model to be used across multiple environments, even if the WebLogic installation directory is different. Path tokens can be used at any location in the model that specifies a file or directory location. The supported tokens are:\n@@ORACLE_HOME@@ - The location where WebLogic Server and any other FMW products are installed (in older versions, this was known as the MW_HOME). @@WL_HOME@@ - The location within the Oracle Home where WebLogic Server is installed (for example, the $ORACLE_HOME/wlserver directory in 12.1.2+). @@DOMAIN_HOME@@ - The location of the domain home directory on which the tool is working. @@PWD@@ - The current working directory from which the tool was invoked. @@TMP@@ - The location of the temporary directory, as controlled by the java.io.tmpdir system property. Model semantics When modeling configuration attributes that can have multiple values, the WebLogic Deploy Tooling tries to make this as painless as possible. For example, the Target attribute on resources can have zero or more clusters and/or servers specified. When specifying the value of such list attributes, the user has freedom to specify them as a list or as a comma-delimited string (comma is the only recognized delimiter for lists). For attributes where the values can legally contain commas, the items must be specified as a list. Examples of each are shown below.\nresources: JDBCSystemResource: MyStringDataSource: Target: AdminServer,mycluster JdbcResource: JDBCDataSourceParams: JNDIName: jdbc/generic1, jdbc/special1 ... MyListDataSource: Target: [ AdminServer, mycluster ] JdbcResource: JDBCDataSourceParams: JNDIName: [ jdbc/generic2, jdbc/special2 ] ... WLDFSystemResource: MyWldfModule: Target: mycluster WLDFResource: Harvester: HarvestedType: weblogic.management.runtime.ServerRuntimeMBean: Enabled: true HarvestedInstance: [ 'com.bea:Name=AdminServer,Type=ServerRuntime', 'com.bea:Name=m1,Type=ServerRuntime' ] ... In the example above, the Target attribute is specified three different ways, as a comma-separated string, as a list, and as a single string in the case of where there is only a single target. The JNDIName attribute is specified as a comma-separated string and as a list (a single string also works). On the other hand, the HarvestedInstances attribute had to be specified as a list because each element contains commas.\nOne of the primary goals of the WebLogic Deploy Tooling is to support a sparse model where the user can specify just the configuration needed for a particular situation. What this implies varies somewhat between the tools but, in general, this implies that the tools are using an additive model. That is, the tools add to what is already there in the existing domain or domain templates (when creating a new domain) rather than making the domain conform exactly to the specified model. Where it makes sense, a similar, additive approach is taken when setting the value of multi-valued attributes. For example, if the model specified the cluster mycluster as the target for an artifact, the tooling will add mycluster to any existing list of targets for the artifact. While the development team has tried to mark attributes that do not make sense to merge accordingly in our knowledge base, this behavior can be disabled on an attribute-by-attribute basis, by adding an additional annotation in the knowledge base data files. The development team is already thinking about how to handle situations that require a non-additive, converge-to-the-model approach, and how that might be supported, but this still remains a wish list item. Users with these requirements should raise an issue for this support.\nDeclaring named MBeans to delete With WebLogic Deploy Tooling, you can specify named items in the model to be deleted using the Create Domain, Update Domain, and Deploy Applications Tools. Named items are those that have multiple instances that are distinguished by user-provided names, such as managed servers, data sources, and security realms. Items to be deleted are prepended with an exclamation point (!) in the model. NOTE: The Deploy Applications Tool is deprecated in WDT 4.0.0.\nIn this example, the managed server obsoleteServer will be deleted, and newServer will be created:\nNote that the exclamation point, along with the name, should be inside quotation marks:\nServer: '!obsoleteServer': newServer: ListenAddress: 127.0.0.1 ListenPort: 9005 This feature can also remove items that were created by WebLogic Server templates. For example, the base template creates a default security realm called myrealm. If a user chooses to declare a custom realm, myrealm is no longer needed. In this example, myrealm will be deleted, and the custom realm newrealm will be created, and declared as the default realm:\nSecurityConfiguration: DefaultRealm: newrealm Realm: '!myrealm': newrealm: AuthenticationProvider: ... This feature does not apply to named security providers within a realm. These items follow a special set of rules that are required to maintain their ordering. See Modeling security providers for detailed information.\nThis feature can be used to undeploy applications or remove libraries.\nDeclaring list items to delete In addition to deleting named mbeans, you can remove items from a list. Most practically, this would be within a Target list.\nJMSSystemResource: BPMJMSModule: Target: soa_cluster,'!AdminServer' In this example, the BPMJMSModule has the AdminServer target removed from the target list.\nUsing multiple models The Create Domain, Update Domain, Deploy Applications, and Validate Model Tools allow the specification of multiple models on the command line. For example:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\createDomain.cmd -model_file modelOne,modelTwo,modelThree ... In this case, the models are merged into a single model before being applied. Each successive model is added to the previous model. In cases where entities exist in both models, the attributes are combined and attribute values from successive models prevail. The resulting model is then verified before being applied. For example, if Model 1 looks like:\ntopology: Server: m1: ListenPort: 7000 Notes: Server 1 m2: ListenPort: 9000 and Model 2 looks like:\ntopology: Server: m1: ListenAddress: myhostname ListenPort: 8000 m3: ListenPort: 10000 The attributes for server m1 are merged, server m2 is left unchanged, and server m3 is added. The resulting model would be:\ntopology: Server: m1: ListenAddress: myhostname ListenPort: 8000 Notes: Server 1 m2: ListenPort: 9000 m3: ListenPort: 10000 If variable properties are used in element names, such as @@PROP:my-server@@, the names in both models will be resolved and matching elements will be merged.\nMultiple models and delete notation A named element using delete notation will completely delete an element with a matching name and no delete notation in a previous model. For example, if Model 1 looks like:\ntopology: Server: m1: ListenPort: 7000 Notes: Server 1 m2: ListenPort: 9000 and Model 2 looks like:\ntopology: Server: '!m2': The resulting model would be:\ntopology: Server: m1: ListenPort: 7000 Notes: Server 1 Similarly, an element without delete notation will completely replace an element with a matching name that has delete notation in a previous model. For example, if Model 1 looks like:\ntopology: Server: '!m1': and Model 2 looks like:\ntopology: Server: m1: ListenPort: 7000 Notes: Server 1 The resulting model would be:\ntopology: Server: m1: ListenPort: 7000 Notes: Server 1 Upgrading from WDT 1.x to current WDT version YAML files Beginning in 2.0, WebLogic Deploy Tooling now incorporates the SnakeYAML parser for reading and writing model files. This may require some changes to existing models in order to be parsed correctly.\nModel elements that use delete notation need to be escaped in single or double quotation marks. topology: Server: '!ms1': ms2: Model elements under the same parent should be indented to the exact same level. The previous YAML parser did not enforce this restriction, but it is standard for YAML. In this example, each cluster is indented four spaces. topology: Cluster: cluster1: ClientCertProxyEnabled: True cluster2: WeblogicPluginEnabled: true Object lists in the kubernetes section of the model must be specified in a hyphenated list format, similar to how they appear in the domain resource file produced for\nWebLogic Kubernetes Operator .\nclusters: - clusterName: 'cluster1' allowReplicasBelowMinDynClusterSize: true - clusterName: 'cluster2' allowReplicasBelowMinDynClusterSize: true Support for the old “named object list” format in the kubernetes section has been removed and will result in validation errors if not converted to the hyphenated list format. clusters: 'cluster1': allowReplicasBelowMinDynClusterSize: true 'cluster2': allowReplicasBelowMinDynClusterSize: true The deprecated argument -model_sample has been removed from the Model Help Tool. The Model Help Tool has used model sample format, by default, since release 1.9.2.",

    "content": "The Update Domain Tool uses a model, the archive, and WLST to update the configuration of an existing WebLogic Server domain, and to deploy applications and resources into the domain in either WLST online or offline mode. The Update Domain Tool will add or re-configure elements from the topology section of the model, and deploy applications and resources from the resources and appDeployments sections.\nLike the Discover Domain Tool, the Update Domain Tool can be run in either offline or online mode, and online mode has some options that control its behavior.\noffline mode - Offline mode uses WLST offline to read and update the domain configuration from the domain home directory. This means that the tool must run on the same host as the domain’s Administration Server and that the user running the tool needs full read and write access to the domain home directory structure. online mode - Online mode uses WLST online to read and update the domain configuration using the Administration Server’s MBeans. The user running the tool needs to provide the administrative credentials and URL to connect to the Administration Server. There are three options when running the tool: Normal mode (default) - In this mode, the tool must run on the same host as the domain’s Administration Server and the user running the tool must have full read and write access to the domain home directory structure, and full read access to any other locations where domain-specific files are stored. -remote mode - This mode allows the tool to be run from a host other than the host where the domain’s Administration Server is located. Since the tool has no direct access to the file system of the host where the Administration Server is running, there are limitations: Any attribute in the model that referenced a path into the archive file unless the path begins with wlsdeploy/applications or wlsdeploy/sharedLibraries will result in an error, as the tool cannot remotely create such directory or file. For example, if you specify a domainBin: [ wlsdeploy/domainBin/setUserOverrides.sh ] which references a file entry in the archive file wlsdeploy/domainBin/setUserOverrides.sh, the tool will fail with an error. Exploded format applications and shared libraries in the archive are not supported. This is due to a limitation in the WebLogic Deploy subsystem where it only supports uploading a file, not a directory. SSH mode - In this mode, the tool can be run from any host for which you have set up SSH connectivity between the host where WDT is running and the host where the Administration Server is running. The -ssh_user (which, by default, is the same user running the tool) must have full read and write access to the domain home directory structure, and full read access to any other locations where domain-specific files are stored. See the SSH support and Verify SSH Tool pages for more information about running in SSH mode. The Update Domain Tool will only add or update elements in the specified model. It will not attempt to remove any missing elements that are already present in the domain. The Update Domain Tool will not attempt to recreate or add schemas for the RCU database, for domain types that use RCU.\nIn WLST online mode, the tool tries to minimize the need to redeploy the applications and shared libraries, and the need to restart the server. It does this in a few ways:\nIf the model references an application or shared library that is already deployed, the tool compares the binaries to determine whether redeployment is required. Redeployment of shared libraries is particularly expensive since all applications using the shared library must be redeployed–even if the application has not changed. It looks at the knowledge base to determine which attributes require restart when they are changed. If an attribute requires restart, the tool compares the current domain and model values to make sure that they are different before trying to apply a change. The goal is to make the tool both able to support iterative deployment and able to minimize service disruption while doing its work when working against a running domain.\nOnline update for shared libraries When updating shared library online, it is recommended to deploy a new version of the library by updating the version(s) in the MANIFEST.MF file and update the deployment descriptor of any application that wants to upgrade to use the new library, this avoids complicated issues like in-place update of shared library.\nIn-place update of shared library online is not supported. If you only update the library contents without updating the version(s) of the library in the MANIFEST.MF file. You will get an error from WebLogic Server indicating the library is referenced by applications and cannot be undeployed. You must undeploy all applications referencing the shared library first before proceeding; this is the same behavior when using the WebLogic Server console. Also, a shared library can potentially be referenced by another shared library module which in turns used by other applications, currently there is no capability within WebLogic Server to handle automating undeploy and deploy of an application that uses shared library when the library is updated in-place.\nUsing output files If the -output_dir command-line argument is specified, the tool will generate output files that provide information about servers and resources that need to be restarted. These files are only applicable for online deployments.\nThe file restart.file contains a list of servers and resources that need to be restarted. Here is an example:\n:AdminServer:Generic1:JDBCSystemResource :AdminServer:: The file non_dynamic_changes.file contains text describing the attributes that will require a restart in order for new values to be applied. Here is an example:\nServer re-start is REQUIRED for the set of changes in progress. The following non-dynamic attribute(s) have been changed on MBeans that require server re-start: MBean Changed : com.bea:Name=AdminServer,Type=Log,Server=AdminServer Attributes changed : RedirectStderrToServerLogEnabled, RedirectStdoutToServerLogEnabled MBean Changed : com.bea:Name=MailSession-0,Type=MailSession Attributes changed : SessionPasswordEncrypted The file results.json contains information about servers and resources need to be restarted, and attribute values that require a restart in order for new values to be applied.\n{ \"nonDynamicChanges\" : { \"com.bea:Name=MailSession-0,Type=MailSession\" : [ \"SessionPasswordEncrypted\" ], \"com.bea:Name=AdminServer,Type=Log,Server=AdminServer\" : [ \"RedirectStderrToServerLogEnabled\", \"RedirectStdoutToServerLogEnabled\" ] }, \"nonDynamicChangesText\" : [ \"\", \"Server re-start is REQUIRED for the set of changes in progress.\", \"\", \"The following non-dynamic attribute(s) have been changed on MBeans\", \"that require server re-start:\", \"MBean Changed : com.bea:Name=AdminServer,Type=Log,Server=AdminServer\", \"Attributes changed : RedirectStderrToServerLogEnabled, RedirectStdoutToServerLogEnabled\", \"\", \"MBean Changed : com.bea:Name=MailSession-0,Type=MailSession\", \"Attributes changed : SessionPasswordEncrypted\", \"\" ], \"restarts\" : [ { \"server\" : \"AdminServer\", \"resourceName\" : \"Generic1\", \"resourceType\" : \"JDBCSystemResource\" }, { \"server\" : \"AdminServer\" } ] } Running the tool in offline mode Running the Update Domain Tool in WLST offline mode is very similar to running the Create Domain Tool; simply provide the domain location and archive file, and separate model and variable files, if needed. For example:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\updateDomain.cmd -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -domain_home domains\\DemoDomain -model_file DemoDomain.yaml -variable_file DemoDomain.properties -archive_file DemoDomain.zip Unlike the Create Domain Tool, the full domain home directory is specified, rather than the domain’s parent directory, because the domain has already been established.\nRunning the tool in online mode In WLST online mode, simply remove the -domain_home argument and add the information on how to connect to the WebLogic Server Administration Server. Here is an example of running in online WLST mode from the admin server:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\updateDomain.cmd -admin_url t3://127.0.0.1:7001 -admin_user weblogic -oracle_home c:\\wls12213≈ -model_file DemoDomain.yaml -variable_file DemoDomain.properties -archive_file DemoDomain.zip Here is an example of running the tool in -remote mode:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\updateDomain.cmd -remote -admin_url t3://my.remote.machine:7001 -admin_user weblogic -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -model_file DemoDomain.yaml -variable_file DemoDomain.properties -archive_file DemoDomain.zip Running in SSH mode looks very similar. This example assumes that you have already set up and verified SSH connectivity from the host where WDT is running to the host where the domain’s Administration Server is running. It also assumes that the default values for the other SSH-related arguments are sufficient for your configuration.\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\updateDomain.cmd -ssh_host my.remote.machine -admin_url t3://my.remote.machine:7001 -admin_user weblogic -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -model_file DemoDomain.yaml -variable_file DemoDomain.properties -archive_file DemoDomain.zip As usual, the tool will prompt for the password (it can also be supplied by piping it to standard input of the tool). To bypass the prompt, you can use one of two options:\nStore the password in an environment variable, and use the variable name with command-line option -admin_pass_env. Store the password in a file. Provide the file name with command-line option -admin_pass_file. When running the tool in WLST online mode, the update operation may require server restarts or a domain restart to pick up the changes. The update operation can also encounter situations where it cannot complete its operation until the domain is restarted. To communicate these conditions to scripts that may be calling the Update Domain Tool, the shell scripts have two special, non-zero exit codes to communicate these states:\n103 - The entire domain needs to be restarted. 104 - The domain changes have been canceled because the changes in the model requires a domain restart and -cancel_changes_if_restart_required is specified. Using an encrypted model If the model or variables file contains passwords encrypted with the WDT Encrypt Model Tool, you must provide the WDT encryption passphrase used to encrypt the model so that the Create Domain Tool can decrypt them. To do this, provide one of the following command-line arguments:\n-passphrase_env \u003cENV_VAR\u003e - read the passphrase from the specified environment variable, -passphrase_file \u003cfile-name\u003e - read the passphrase from a file that contains the passphrase, or -passphrase_prompt - have the tool read the passphrase from stdin, either by prompting or piping the value to the shell script’s standard input. Using multiple models The Update Domain Tool supports the use of multiple models, as described in Using multiple models .\nEnvironment variables The following environment variables may be set.\nJAVA_HOME The location of the JDK. This must be a valid Java 7 or later JDK. WLSDEPLOY_PROPERTIES System properties that will be passed to WLST. Warning When running the Update Domain Tool (and any other tool that use WLST), the actual JDK used to run the tool will be the JDK used to install WebLogic Server in the Oracle Home and not the one defined by the JAVA_HOME environment variable. The best practice is to set JAVA_HOME to point to the same JDK installation that was used to install WebLogic Server.\nOpening an issue against the Update Domain Tool Please provide the full console output of the tool (that is, what is printed to stdout and stderr) and the log file, updateDomain.log, which is typically found in the \u003cinstall home\u003e/weblogic-deploy/logs directory. If possible, please provide the model, variable and archive files, and any other information that helps to understand the environment, what you are doing, and what is happening. For example, when running in online mode and encountering an error deploying an application, the domain’s Administration Server log file will often be the key to understanding the cause of the error.\nParameter table for updateDomain Parameter Definition Default -admin_pass_env An alternative to entering the admin password at a prompt. The value is an environment variable name that WDT will use to retrieve the password. -admin_pass_file An alternative to entering the admin password at a prompt. The value is a the name of a file that contains a password string that the tool will read to retrieve the password. -admin_url The admin server URL for online update. -admin_user The admin user name for online update. -archive_file The path to the archive file to use. If the -model_file argument is not specified, the model file in this archive will be used. This can also be specified as a comma-separated list of archive files. The overlapping contents in each archive take precedence over previous archives in the list. -cancel_changes_if_restart_required Cancel the changes if the update requires domain restart. -discard_current_edit Discard all existing domain edits before the update. -domain_home (Required for offline mode) The location of the existing local domain home. For online mode, the server’s value. -domain_type The type of domain. (for example, WLS, JRF) WLS -model_file The location of the model file. This can also be specified as a comma-separated list of model locations, where each successive model layers on top of the previous ones. -oracle_home Home directory of the Oracle WebLogic installation. Required if the ORACLE_HOME environment variable is not set. -output_dir If specified, files containing restart information are written to this directory, including restart.file, non_dynamic_changes.file, and results.json. -passphrase_env An alternative to entering the encryption passphrase at a prompt. The value is an environment variable name that WDT will use to retrieve the passphrase. -passphrase_file An alternative to entering the encryption passphrase at a prompt. The value is a the name of a file with a string value which WDT will read to retrieve the passphrase. -passphrase_prompt Allow WDT to prompt for the encryption passphrase or read it from stdin. -remote Update the domain from a remote machine. -ssh_host The DNS name or IP address of the remote host. -ssh_pass_env The environment variable name to use to retrieve the remote user’s password when authenticating with user name and password. -ssh_pass_file The file name of a file that contains the password string for the remote user’s password when authenticating with user name and password. -ssh_pass_prompt A flag to force the tool to prompt the user to provide the remote user’s password through standard input when authenticating with user name and password. Do not prompt or read from standard input. -ssh_port The TCP port on the remote host where the sshd daemon is listening for connection requests. 22 -ssh_private_key The local file name of the user’s private key file to use when authenticating with a public/private key pair. $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa -ssh_private_key_pass_env The environment variable name to use to retrieve user’s private key passphrase when authenticating with a public/private key pair. -ssh_private_key_pass_file The file name of a file that contains the user’s private key passphrase string when authenticating with a public/private key pair. -ssh_private_key_pass_prompt A flag to force the tool to prompt the user to provide their private key passphrase through standard input when authenticating with a public/private key pair. Do not prompt or read from standard input. -ssh_user The user name on the remote host to use for authentication purposes. Same as the local user running the tool. -use_encryption (deprecated) Replaced by the -passphrase_prompt argument. -variable_home The location of the property file containing the values for variables used in the model. This can also be specified as a comma-separated list of property files, where each successive set of properties layers on top of the previous ones. -wait_for_edit_lock Skip checks for active edit sessions and pending changes before trying to acquire the WLST online edit lock to modify domain configuration.",

    "content": "WebLogic Deploy Tool uses a set of JSON configuration files to map folders and attributes in the model to the corresponding WLST MBeans and their attributes. These mappings are referred as ‘aliases’ throughout the project code and documentation. Each element in the alias definition file has detailed properties that assist in this mapping.\nThe model’s folder and attribute names usually match the names of the corresponding elements in WLST. For cases where the names of WLST elements may change across WebLogic Server releases, the names should match the names in the 12.2.1.3 release. The unit test AttributesTestCase verifies that this convention is used, and identifies a few exceptions.\nAttributes that are introduced after the 12.2.1.3 release should, in most cases, match the name of the first WebLogic Server release in which they appear. The unit test AttributesTestCase will ignore these for now, because they will not be present in the 12.2.1.3 alias structure.\nThe alias definition files reside in the directory:\n$WLSDEPLOY_HOME/core/src/main/resources/oracle/weblogic/deploy/aliases/category_module\nEach definition file corresponds to a second-level folder within the model, such as JDBCSystemResource. Any elements below a second-level folder are defined in the file of that parent. For example, the model element resources/JDBCSystemResource/JdbcResource/JDBCConnectionPoolParams is described in JDBCSystemResource.json.\nTop-level elements such as topology and resources are for organizational purposes, and are not represented in the alias definition files.\nNo elements in the domainInfo section of the model are represented in the alias definitions, because they don’t correspond directly to WLST elements.\nThis example, from the file JDBCSystemResource.json, will be used as a reference in the descriptions below:\n{ \"copyright\": \"Copyright (c) 2017, 2018, Oracle Corporation and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.\", \"license\": \"Licensed under the Universal Permissive License v 1.0 as shown at https://oss.oracle.com/licenses/upl\", \"wlst_type\": \"JDBCSystemResource${:s}\", \"child_folders_type\": \"multiple\", \"folders\": { \"JdbcResource\" : { \"wlst_type\": \"${Jdbc:JDBC}Resource\", \"folders\": { \"JDBCConnectionPoolParams\": { \"wlst_type\": \"JDBCConnectionPoolParams\", \"folders\": {}, \"attributes\": { \"CapacityIncrement\": [ {\"version\": \"[10,)\", \"wlst_mode\": \"both\", \"wlst_name\": \"CapacityIncrement\", \"wlst_path\": \"WP001\", \"default_value\": \"${__NULL__:1}\", \"wlst_type\": \"integer\", \"get_method\": \"LSA\"} ], \"ConnectionCreationRetryFrequencySeconds\": [ {\"version\": \"[10,)\", \"wlst_mode\": \"both\", \"wlst_name\": \"ConnectionCreationRetryFrequencySeconds\", \"wlst_path\": \"WP001\", \"default_value\": \"${__NULL__:0}\", \"wlst_type\": \"integer\", \"get_method\": \"LSA\"} ] }, \"wlst_attributes_path\": \"WP001\", \"wlst_paths\": { \"WP001\": \"/JDBCSystemResource${:s}/%DATASOURCE%/${Jdbc:JDBC}Resource/%DATASOURCE%/JDBCConnectionPoolParams/${NO_NAME_0:%DATASOURCE%}\" } }, ... Conventions Notations similar to ${Jdbc:JDBC}Resource appear throughout this example, and other alias definition files. It is shorthand for the common situation where a value is different between offline and online WLST. The value before the colon is used in offline processing, and the value after is used for online. In this example, the value for wlst_type is JdbcResource in offline, and JDBCResource in online. This notation can be used for values in most places in the model. It cannot be used for key values, such as wlst_type.\nKeys for top level and folders elements These JSON keys are applicable for the top-level element (such as JDBCSystemResource), and each of its nested folders elements (such as JdbcResource and JdbcResource/JDBCConnectionPoolParams.\nwlst_type This value is the type name of the WLST MBean that corresponds to a model folder. The ${x:y} notation described above is often used here to distinguish offline and online folder names.\nchild_folders_type This value specifies how the tool will map the domain model element to one or more WLST MBeans. The values are:\nsingle (default) - this element represents a single MBean, and the MBean name is known.\nsingle-unpredictable - this element represents a single MBean, but the MBean name must be derived at runtime.\nmultiple - this element contains multiple named elements (such as dataSource1, dataSource2), and each represents a single MBean.\nfolders Nested WLST MBean types for the current MBean are listed here. Each has a domain model type name, followed by its own JSON keyed elements.\nwlst_attributes_path This key element specifies the name of the path expression used for navigating to the MBean attributes folder. The actual path expression is defined later in the \"wlst_paths\": { } element.\nwlst_paths The dictionary key defines the various WLST path values used elsewhere in this folder’s definition. Each entry maps a name to a full WLST MBean path. In this example, JDBCConnectionPoolParams has a single path:\n\"WP001\": \"/JDBCSystemResource${:s}/%DATASOURCE%/${Jdbc:JDBC}Resource/%DATASOURCE%/JDBCConnectionPoolParams/${NO_NAME_0:%DATASOURCE%}\"\nThe %DATASOURCE% text is token placeholder. It will be replaced with the name of the actual data source by the tool.\nKeys for attributes elements Each child of an attributes element represents a single MBean attribute, and its key is the corresponding model name, such as CapacityIncrement. It contains at least one description element with the JSON keys below. There may be multiple description elements for cases where the configuration varies for different WebLogic Server version ranges, or varies between offline and online WLST.\nversion This key element defines the applicable versions for a particular MBean attribute description. Maven versioning conventions are used to describe ranges and limits. For example:\n\"version\": \"[10,)\"\nSpecifies that an MBean attribute description is relevant for WebLogic Server version 10 and later\nwlst_mode This key element specifies the WLST modes that are applicable for an MBean attribute description. The value can be “offline”, “online”, or “both”.\nwlst_name This key element specifies the WLST name of the MBean attribute.\nwlst_type This key element specifies the data type used to set the WLST MBean attribute. Valid values are integer, long, string, delimited_string, boolean and jarray. If the wlst_read_type is not set, this is also the data type used to read the value from WLST.\nwlst_read_type This key element specifies the data type used to read the WLST MBean attribute. If it is not specified, the value of wlst_type is used for the read.\nget_method This key element specifies which method should be used for retrieving the value the MBean attribute. Valid values are:\nGET use the WLST get method to retrieve the value of the attribute LSA use ls(type=‘a’) to retrieve the value of the attribute NONE do not retrieve the attribute value access By default, an attribute is read write in both WLST and MODEL. This element is used to set an attribute to read-only or ignored. The two attribute values are:\nRO indicates that the attribute is read-only and will not be written into the domain; however, it will be discovered and written into the model by the Discover Domain Tool. IGNORED indicates that the attribute is both known and tolerated in the model but is never discovered or written into the domain. preferred_model_type This key element specifies the preferred data type that should be used to put data in the model during discovery. As an example, list values can be represented in the model as comma-separated text, such as \"value1, value2\", or as a YAML list, such as [\"value1\", \"value2\"]. If the list values can contain commas, a YAML list must be used.\nwlst_path This key element specifies the name of the path expression used for navigating to the MBean attribute’s folder. This name maps to an entry in the parent folder’s \"wlst_paths\": { } list.\ndefault_value This key element specifies the default value of the MBean attribute. For example:\n\"default_value\": \"text\"\n\"default_value\": 99\n\"default_value\": null\n\"default_value\": \"${__NULL__:1}\"\nThe __NULL__ key represents a null value when \"${a:b}\" notation is used to specify offline and online values.\nproduction_default This key element specifies the default value to use for a domain in production mode. The value formats are similar to those for default_value. A null value indicates that production_default should be disregarded, and the default_value should be used.\nsecure_default This key element specifies the default value to use for a domain in secure mode. The value formats are similar to those for default_value. A null value indicates that secure_default should be disregarded, and the default_value should be used.\nsecure_default_null This key element specifies that null should be used as the default value for a domain in secure mode. This is distinct from setting secure_default to null, which results in the value being disregarded.\nset_method For cases where attributes cannot be set with simple types, it may be necessary to use a custom method to set the value. For example, most Target attributes require their values to be set as lists of MBeans, in online mode. This may be defined as:\n\"attributes\": { \"Target\": [ { \"set_method\": \"MBEAN.set_target_mbeans\", \"set_mbean_type\": \"weblogic.management.configuration.TargetMBean\"} ], }, The method set_target_mbeans directs the tool to call the Jython method attribute_setter.set_target_mbeans to set this value.\nset_mbean_type When a set_method key is specified, it may be required to specify the MBean type for the set method to use (see the example under set_method).",

    "content": "Note The Deploy Applications Tool is deprecated in WDT 4.0.0. For comparable functionality and more, use the Update Domain Tool .\nThe Deploy Applications Tool uses a model, the archive, and WLST to deploy applications and resources into an existing WebLogic Server domain in either WLST online or offline mode. When deploying applications and resources from a model, the Deploy Applications Tool focuses primarily on the resources and appDeployments sections of the model. There are exceptions for the domainInfo and topology sections, where those configuration elements are deemed to be “application-related.” For example, the servers’ ServerStart folder has an Arguments and a ClassPath attribute that change the server environment (when started by the Node Manager) that applications may rely on to function properly. Likewise, the domainInfo section contains a list of JAR files that are to be placed in \u003cDOMAIN_HOME\u003e/lib which are relevant to applications for a similar reason.\nLike the Update Domain Tool, the Deploy Applications Tool can be run in either offline or online mode, and online mode has some options that control its behavior.\noffline mode - Offline mode uses WLST offline to read and update the domain configuration from the domain home directory. This means that the tool must run on the same host as the domain’s Administration Server and that the user running the tool needs full read and write access to the domain home directory structure. online mode - Online mode uses WLST online to read and update the domain configuration using the Administration Server’s MBeans. The user running the tool needs to provide the administrative credentials and URL to connect to the Administration Server. There are three options when running the tool: Normal mode (default) - In this mode, the tool must run on the same host as the domain’s Administration Server and the user running the tool must have full read and write access to the domain home directory structure, and full read access to any other locations where domain-specific files are stored. -remote mode - This mode allows the tool to be run from a host other than the host where the domain’s Administration Server is located. Since the tool has no direct access to the file system of the host where the Administration Server is running, there are limitations: Any attribute in the model that referenced a path into the archive file unless the path begins with wlsdeploy/applications or wlsdeploy/sharedLibraries will result in an error, as the tool cannot remotely create such directory or file. For example, if you specify a domainBin: [ wlsdeploy/domainBin/setUserOverrides.sh ] which references a file entry in the archive file wlsdeploy/domainBin/setUserOverrides.sh, the tool will fail with an error. Exploded format applications and shared libraries in the archive are not supported. This is due to a limitation in the WebLogic Deploy subsystem where it only supports uploading a file, not a directory. SSH mode - In this mode, the tool can be run from any host for which you have set up SSH connectivity between the host where WDT is running and the host where the Administration Server is running. The -ssh_user (which, by default, is the same user running the tool) must have full read and write access to the domain home directory structure, and full read access to any other locations where domain-specific files are stored. See the SSH support and Verify SSH Tool pages for more information about running in SSH mode. The Deploy Applications Tool will only add or update elements in the specified model. It will not attempt to remove any missing elements that are already present in the domain. The Update Domain Tool will not attempt to recreate or add schemas for the RCU database, for domain types that use RCU.\nIn WLST online mode, the tool tries to minimize the need to redeploy the applications and shared libraries, and the need to restart the server. It does this in a few ways:\nIf the model references an application or shared library that is already deployed, the tool compares the binaries to determine whether redeployment is required. Redeployment of shared libraries is particularly expensive since all applications using the shared library must be redeployed–even if the application has not changed. It looks at the knowledge base to determine which attributes require restart when they are changed. If an attribute requires restart, the tool compares the current domain and model values to make sure that they are different before trying to apply a change. The goal is to make the tool both able to support iterative deployment and able to minimize service disruption while doing its work when working against a running domain.\nOnline update for shared libraries When updating shared library online, it is recommended to deploy a new version of the library by updating the version(s) in the MANIFEST.MF file and update the deployment descriptor of any application that wants to upgrade to use the new library, this avoids complicated issues like in-place update of shared library.\nIn-place update of shared library online is not supported. If you only update the library contents without updating the version(s) of the library in the MANIFEST.MF file. You will get an error from WebLogic Server indicating the library is referenced by applications and cannot be undeployed. You must undeploy all applications referencing the shared library first before proceeding; this is the same behavior when using the WebLogic Server console. Also, a shared library can potentially be referenced by another shared library module which in turns used by other applications, currently there is no capability within WebLogic Server to handle automating undeploy and deploy of an application that uses shared library when the library is updated in-place.\nUsing output files If the -output_dir command-line argument is specified, the tool will generate output files that provide information about servers and resources that need to be restarted. These files are only applicable for online deployments.\nFor more information about these files, see Using output files for the Update Domain Tool.\nRunning the tool in offline mode Running the Deploy Applications Tool in WLST offline mode is very similar to running the Update Domain Tool; simply provide the domain location and archive file, and separate model and variable files, if needed. For example:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\deployApps.cmd -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -domain_home domains\\DemoDomain -model_file DemoDomain.yaml -variable_file DemoDomain.properties -archive_file DemoDomain.zip Running the tool in online mode In WLST online mode, simply remove the -domain_home argument and add the information on how to connect to the WebLogic Server Administration Server. Here is an example of running in online WLST mode from the admin server:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\deployApps.cmd -admin_url t3://127.0.0.1:7001 -admin_user weblogic -oracle_home c:\\wls12213≈ -model_file DemoDomain.yaml -variable_file DemoDomain.properties -archive_file DemoDomain.zip Here is an example of running the tool in -remote mode:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\deployApps.cmd -remote -admin_url t3://my.remote.machine:7001 -admin_user weblogic -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -model_file DemoDomain.yaml -variable_file DemoDomain.properties -archive_file DemoDomain.zip Running in SSH mode looks very similar. This example assumes that you have already set up and verified SSH connectivity from the host where WDT is running to the host where the domain’s Administration Server is running. It also assumes that the default values for the other SSH-related arguments are sufficient for your configuration.\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\deployApps.cmd -ssh_host my.remote.machine -admin_url t3://my.remote.machine:7001 -admin_user weblogic -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -model_file DemoDomain.yaml -variable_file DemoDomain.properties -archive_file DemoDomain.zip As usual, the tool will prompt for the password (it can also be supplied by piping it to standard input of the tool). To bypass the prompt, you can use one of two options:\nStore the password in an environment variable, and use the variable name with command-line option -admin_pass_env. Store the password in a file. Provide the file name with command-line option -admin_pass_file. When running the tool in WLST online mode, the deploy operation may require server restarts or a domain restart to pick up the changes. The deploy operation can also encounter situations where it cannot complete its operation until the domain is restarted. To communicate these conditions to scripts that may be calling the Deploy Applications Tool, the shell scripts have two special, non-zero exit codes to communicate these states:\n103 - The entire domain needs to be restarted. 104 - The domain changes have been canceled because the changes in the model requires a domain restart and -cancel_changes_if_restart_required is specified. Using an encrypted model If the model or variables file contains passwords encrypted with the WDT Encrypt Model Tool, you must provide the WDT encryption passphrase used to encrypt the model so that the Create Domain Tool can decrypt them. To do this, provide one of the following command-line arguments:\n-passphrase_env \u003cENV_VAR\u003e - read the passphrase from the specified environment variable, -passphrase_file \u003cfile-name\u003e - read the passphrase from a file that contains the passphrase, or -passphrase_prompt - have the tool read the passphrase from stdin, either by prompting or piping the value to the shell script’s standard input. Using multiple models The Deploy Applications Tool supports the use of multiple models, as described in Using multiple models .\nEnvironment variables The following environment variables may be set.\nJAVA_HOME The location of the JDK. This must be a valid Java 7 or later JDK. WLSDEPLOY_PROPERTIES System properties that will be passed to WLST. Warning When running the Deploy Applications Tool (and any other tool that use WLST), the actual JDK used to run the tool will be the JDK used to install WebLogic Server in the Oracle Home and not the one defined by the JAVA_HOME environment variable. The best practice is to set JAVA_HOME to point to the same JDK installation that was used to install WebLogic Server.\nOpening an issue against the Deploy Applications Tool Please provide the full console output of the tool (that is, what is printed to stdout and stderr) and the log file, deployApps.log, which is typically found in the \u003cinstall home\u003e/weblogic-deploy/logs directory. If possible, please provide the model, variable and archive files, and any other information that helps to understand the environment, what you are doing, and what is happening.

    "content": "The Discover Domain Tool provides a bootstrapping mechanism to creating a model and archive file by inspecting an existing domain and gathering configuration and binaries from it.\nBy default, the model file produced by the tool is not directly usable by the Create Domain, Update Domain or the Deploy Applications Tools because the Discover Domain Tool does not discover the passwords from the existing domain. Instead, it puts a --FIX ME-- placeholder for passwords it finds. Security provider data is also not discovered by default. Therefore, the tool injects the same placeholder value in the AdminUserName and AdminPassword fields in the domainInfo section of the model. The idea of this tool is simply to provide a starting point where the user can edit the generated model and archive file to suit their needs for running one of the other tools.\nIn WDT 4.2.0, several optional features have been added to change the default behavior that make it possible to discover passwords and the security providers data that give the Discover Domain Tool the ability to produce a fully populated model that is usable by the other tools without editing the model file. Please see the Discovering security information section for more information.\nThe Discover Domain tool can be run in either offline or online mode, and each mode has some options that control its behavior.\noffline mode - Offline mode uses WLST offline to read the domain configuration from the domain home directory. This means that the tool must run on the same host as the domain’s Administration Server and that the user running the tool needs full read access to the domain home directory structure. By default, the tool will gather files referenced by the domain configuration (for example, applications, domain libraries) and store those files in a zip file known as the archive file.\nTo prevent the collection of these files, simply add the -skip_archive argument to the command-line use to invoke the tool. This will result in a model file that has the original paths to the files that could not be collected.\nonline mode - Online mode uses WLST online to read the domain configuration using the Administration Server’s MBeans. The user running the tool needs to provide the administrative credentials and URL to connect to the Administration Server. There are four options when running the tool:\nNormal mode (default) - In this mode, the tool must run on the same host as the domain’s Administration Server and the user running the tool must have full read access to the domain home directory structure and any other locations where domain-specific files are stored. -skip_archive mode - In this mode, the tool can be run from anywhere since the archive file is not being created. As with offline mode, this will result in a model file that has the original paths to the files that could not be collected. -remote mode - This mode is similar to -skip_archive mode except that the tool will generate a list of TODO messages that inform the user which artifacts needs to be gathered and added to an archive file in order to create a complete model of the domain. The model file will be populated with the archive paths that need to be collected and added to an archive file to allow a new domain to be created. SSH mode - In this mode, the tool can be run from any host for which you have set up SSH connectivity between the host where WDT is running and the host where the Administration Server is running. The -ssh_user (which, by default, is the same user running the tool) must have full read access to the domain home directory structure and any other locations where domain-specific files are stored on the server. See the SSH support and Verify SSH Tool pages for more information about running in SSH mode. You can customize what is generated in the model for credential-related attributes (that is, user names and passwords) by using the -variable_file argument on the command line with variable file location. This file is a Java properties file which will contain a key=value pair for each credential-related attribute found in the model. The key is a unique token name for the specific attribute, and the value is the replacement value; by default, user name attributes are populated with the discovered value and password attributes are populated with an empty string. The attribute in the model is injected with the token name and property field notation. For example, @@PROP:AdminUserName@@ or @@PROP:JDBCSystemResource.\u003cName\u003e.JdbcResource.JDBCDriverParams.PasswordEncrypted@@.\nIf variable injection is configured, but the -variable_file argument is not used, the variable file is created with the same name as the model file, with the file extension .properties. As with the archive and model file, each run of the Discover Domain Tool will overwrite the contents of an existing variable file with the values from the current run.\nBefore the model is persisted to the model file, any variable injectors or model filters are run, in that order. The final step is validation, which validates the contents of the model, archive and variable file. If the validation is successful, the model is persisted. For more information on these three topics, see:\nVariable injection Model filters Validate Model Tool The resulting model can also be modified for compatibility with specific target environments, such as Oracle WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator. For more information, see Target environments .\nAny problems (or success) will be listed in the Discover Domain Tool summary. The summary will print the version of the tool and Oracle home, and the WLST mode with which the tool was run (online or offline). A recap of all important messages will be listed, along with a total for each type.\nHere is an example of a summary with a single SEVERE message:\nIssue Log for discoverDomain version 4.2.0 running WebLogic version 12.1.3.0.0 in online mode against server using WebLogic version 12.1.3.0.0: SEVERE Messages: 1. WLSDPLY-20008: discoverDomain argument processing failed: discoverDomain invoked with ambiguous configuration: -passphrase argument was specified without one of the associated arguments: -discover_passwords or -discover_security_provider_data. Total: SEVERE : 1 WARNING : 0 discoverDomain.sh failed due to a parameter validation error Running the tool in offline mode To run the Discover Domain Tool in offline mode, simply provide the Oracle home and domain location. Provide a location and file name for the model file and archive file where the discovered domain information will be written. The model can be generated in either YAML or JSON format. Simply label the file name with the correct suffix.\nExample of basic discoverDomain:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\discoverDomain.cmd -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -domain_home domains\\DemoDomain -archive_file DiscoveredDemoDomain.zip -model_file DiscoveredDemoDomain.yaml When creating the archive, the tool will try to gather all binaries, scripts, and required directories referenced by the domain configuration.\nNote Any binaries referenced from the ORACLE_HOME will not be gathered, as they are assumed to exist in any target domain to which model-driven operations will be applied. Doing this is key to allowing the model to be WebLogic Server version independent.\nRunning the tool in online mode To run the Discover Domain Tool in online mode, you have several options as described earlier. In normal mode, WDT must be run on the same host as the Administration Server by a user that has read access to the necessary directories (for example, the domain home directory) to collect the files to populate the archive file. Simply include the admin user name and admin URL on the command line. The tool will prompt for a password to be entered into STDIN. To bypass the prompt, you can use one of three options:\nStore the password in an environment variable, and use the variable name with command-line option -admin_pass_env. Store the password value in a file. Provide the file name with command-line option -admin_pass_file. Pipe the value on STDIN to the shell script. An example of running in online WLST mode from the admin server:\n$ weblogic-deploy/bin/discoverDomain.sh -oracle_home /u01/oracle -domain_home /u01/oracle/domains/DemoDomain -archive_file ./DiscoveredDemoDomain.zip -model_file ./DiscoveredDemoDomain.yaml -admin_user weblogic -admin_url t3://localhost:7001 To run the tool against a remote Administration Server, you can use one of the other modes: -skip_archive, -remote or SSH mode.\nWith -remote, file collection will be skipped and the tool will generate TODO messages for any files that are needed for the domain but could not be gathered. You can manually gather the necessary files and use the Archive Helper Tool to create an archive file to complete the model.\nAn example of running in online WLST mode from a remote host:\n$ weblogic-deploy/bin/discoverDomain.sh -oracle_home /u01/oracle -remote -model_file ./DiscoveredDemoDomain.yaml -admin_user weblogic -admin_url t3://my.remote.host:7001 With SSH mode, the tool will gather the files from the remote machine using SSH and SCP. Please see the SSH Support and Verify SSH Tool pages for more information on setting up and using SSH-based access to remote domains.\nDomain types By default, the Discover Domain Tool, like all other WDT tools, assumes that the domain is a pure WebLogic Server domain. What it means to be a WebLogic Server domain is defined by the WLS typedef file, located at weblogic-deploy/lib/typedefs/WLS.json. Other domain types are known simply by having the corresponding typedef file installed at weblogic-deploy/lib/typedefs/\u003ctype-name\u003e.json. For example, the JRF domain type is defined by the weblogic-deploy/lib/typedefs/JRF.json typedef file.\nWhen discovering a domain of another type, simply add the -domain_type \u003ctype-name\u003e command-line argument; for example, for a JRF domain, add -domain_type JRF to the command-line arguments. Domain typedefs play an important role for the Discover Domain Tool because they apply a set of filters defined in the matching typedef file’s discover-filters section that cause configuration elements to be excluded from the discovered model. The rationale for this is that these domain template-defined resources that are automatically created when creating a new domain of the same type so there is typically no need to clutter the model with these boilerplate resource definitions that users do not typically modify. For more information, refer to Domain type definitions page.\nAn example of using the domain type argument:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\discoverDomain.cmd -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -domain_home domains\\DemoDomain -archive_file DiscoveredDemoDomain.zip -model_file DiscoveredDemoDomain.yaml -domain_type JRF Discovering security information WDT has introduced features that allow you to more fully discover a domain by discovering passwords stored in the domain configuration files and by discovering data from the default security providers. This section discusses those options.\nDiscovering passwords Starting in 4.1.0, the Discover Domain Tool supports discovering passwords from the domain configuration files (for example, config.xml and any JDBCSystemResource XML file) by adding the -discover_passwords flag to the command-line. This feature works in both offline and online modes provided that WDT has access to the domain home directory (that is, it does not work with the online -remote argument). By default, WDT will try to use WDT encryption to encrypt the passwords in the model using the WDT passphrase passed to the tool, which requires using one of the following command-line arguments: -passphrase_env, -passphrase_file, or passphrase_prompt. This allows the user to discover the passwords from a domain and securely store them in the model using technology that is not tied to the source domain.\nWarning WDT provides a configuration setting in tool.properties that allows the passwords to be stored in the model without being encrypted. Oracle strongly recommends that you do not use this feature since not only will it result in passwords being stored in clear text in the model but also may result in passwords in the WDT log files.\nDiscovering default security provider data By default, WebLogic Server domains come configured with four default security provider types that store domain-specific information in them:\nDefaultAuthenticator - stores users and groups. XACMLAuthenticator - stores authorization policies. XACMLRoleMapper - stores role definitions and the rule for mapping those to users and groups. DefaultCredentialMapper - stores credentials for remote endpoints so that an authorized local user can authenticate to the remote endpoint. The WDT model file already has model sections for each of these providers’ data, as follows:\ntopology:/Security/User - is used to create users stored in the DefaultAuthenticator. topology:/Security/Group - is used to create groups stored in the DefaultAuthenticator. domainInfo:/WLSPolicies - is used to create authorization policies stored in the XACMLAuthorizer. domainInfo:/WLSRoles - is used to create WebLogic roles stored in the XACMLRoleMapper. domainInfo:/WLSUserPasswordCredentialMappings - is used to create credential mappings stored in the DefaultCredentialMapper. Starting in 4.2.0, the Discover Domain Tool supports the -discover_security_provider_data \u003cscope\u003e command-line argument. The scope can be one of the following values or a list of some of these value:\nALL - discovers all 4 provider types DefaultAuthenticator - discovers users and groups. XACMLAuthorizer - discovers authorization policies. XACMLRoleMapper - discovers role definitions. DefaultCredentialMapper - discovers credential mappings. The ALL scope is exactly the same as a scope value that lists each of the four provider types (for example, DefaultAuthenticator,XACMLAuthorizer,XACMLRoleMapper,DefaultCredentialMapper)\nNote Discovery filters out all security data that matches the defaults for the WLS version being used except for users, because WDT needs to discover the users’ passwords to use when creating a new domain from the discovered model.\nWhen discovering the DefaultAuthenticator or the DefaultCredentialMapper, any discovered passwords will be stored in the model using WDT encryption; therefore, the WDT encryption passphrase must be provided using one of the following command-line arguments: -passphrase_env, -passphrase_file, or passphrase_prompt. Failure to do so will result in the model password values being set to -- FIX ME --.\nWarning WDT provides a configuration setting in tool.properties that allows the passwords to be stored in the model without being encrypted. Oracle strongly recommends that you do not use this feature since not only will it result in passwords being stored in clear text in the model but also may result in passwords in the WDT log files.\nWhen discovering the XACMLAuthorizer or the XACMLRoleMapper, WDT analyzes the XACML documents to try to determine the policy or expression from which the XACML was generated. If this succeeds, the model will contain that policy or role. If not, the XACML document will be added to the archive file and a reference to that document will be added to the model instead.\nDiscovering the default administrator user name and password A WDT model used to create a domain require that the default administrator user name and password be provided in the domainInfo section’s AdminUserName and AdminPassword attributes. These values are used to populate the domain’s administrative credentials prior to writing the domain to disk. By default, the Discover Domain Tool sets the value of these model attributes to --FIX ME--, or to empty strings if the variables file is being used. When using the -discover_security_provider_data feature, these fields will be populated with the actual administrative user name and password. Since it is not possible to determine the default administrative user name or the password, the tool uses the values passed to the tool on the command-line. If desired, this feature can be disabled using the store.discover.admin_credentials property in the WDT tool.property file\nNote If the domain being discovered has multiple administrators, the administrative credentials provided to the Discover Domain Tool will be the ones added to the model. If the resulting model is used to create another domain, that user will become the default administrator for the new domain. Therefore, it is important to choose the credentials used to invoke the Discover Domain Tool with this in mind.\nDiscovering RCU data sources Starting in 4.3.3, the Discover Domain Tool supports discovering RCU data sources from the domain configuration files by adding the -discover_rcu_datasources flag to the command-line. The RCU data sources are the standard data sources from the domain such as a JRF domain or any domain that uses RCU schemas.\nIf the JDBCDriverParams: URL and PasswordEncrypted are the same across all the RCU data sources, a RCUDbInfo section is generated under the domainInfo section of the model.\ndomainInfo: RCUDbInfo: rcu_db_conn_string: jdbc:oracle:thin:@//nuc:1521/orclpdb1 rcu_prefix: FMW21 rcu_schema_password: --FIX ME-- If the JDBCDriverParams URL and PasswordEncrypted are not the same across all the RCU data sources, then all of them appears as regular data sources in the resources section and no RCUDbInfo section will be generated.\nresources: JDBCSystemResource: WLSSchemaDataSource: JdbcResource: JDBCConnectionPoolParams: TestTableName: SQL ISVALID MaxCapacity: 75 JDBCDataSourceParams: GlobalTransactionsProtocol: None JNDIName: jdbc/WLSSchemaDataSource JDBCDriverParams: URL: jdbc:oracle:thin:@//nuc:1521/orclpdb1 PasswordEncrypted: --FIX ME-- DriverName: oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver Properties: user: Value: FMW21_WLS_RUNTIME LocalSvcTblDataSource: Target: admin-server JdbcResource: JDBCConnectionPoolParams: InitialCapacity: 0 CapacityIncrement: 1 TestConnectionsOnReserve: true ConnectionCreationRetryFrequencySeconds: 10 TestTableName: SQL ISVALID TestFrequencySeconds: 300 SecondsToTrustAnIdlePoolConnection: 0 MaxCapacity: 200 JDBCDataSourceParams: GlobalTransactionsProtocol: None JNDIName: jdbc/LocalSvcTblDataSource JDBCDriverParams: URL: jdbc:oracle:thin:@//nuc:1521/anotherdb PasswordEncrypted: --FIX ME-- DriverName: oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver Properties: user: Value: FMW21_STB oracle.net.CONNECT_TIMEOUT: Value: '10000' SendStreamAsBlob: Value: 'true' weblogic.jdbc.crossPartitionEnabled: Value: 'true' ... This feature works in both offline and online modes provided that WDT has access to the domain home directory (that is, it does not work with the online -remote argument). By default, WDT will try to use WDT encryption to encrypt the passwords in the model using the WDT passphrase passed to the tool, which requires using one of the following command-line arguments: -passphrase_env, -passphrase_file, or passphrase_prompt. This allows the user to discover the passwords from a domain and securely store them in the model using technology that is not tied to the source domain.\nEnvironment variables The following environment variables may be set.\nJAVA_HOME The location of the JDK. This must be a valid Java 7 or later JDK. WLSDEPLOY_PROPERTIES System properties that will be passed to WLST. Warning When running the Discover Domain Tool (and any other tool that use WLST), the actual JDK used to run the tool will be the JDK used to install WebLogic Server in the Oracle Home and not the one defined by the JAVA_HOME environment variable. The best practice is to set JAVA_HOME to point to the same JDK installation that was used to install WebLogic Server.\nOpening an issue against the Discover Domain Tool Please provide the full console output of the tool (that is, what is printed to stdout and stderr) and the log file, discoverDomain.log, which is typically found in the \u003cinstall home\u003e/weblogic-deploy/logs directory.

For example, if you run the validateModel tool then the log file will be $WDT_HOME/logs/validateModel.log. These log files are overwritten each time you run a particular tool so the file contains only the logs from the last tool invocation.\nIf the $WDT_HOME/logs directory is not writable by the user running the tool, the logging framework will search for a location to write the logs. The user must have write permission on the directory in order for it to be selected. The search order is as follows:\nCheck the WLSDEPLOY_LOG_DIRECTORY environment variable. Check the current working directory (as defined by the user.dir Java system property) and create a logs subdirectory. Check the temp directory (as defined by the java.io.tmpdir Java system property) and create a wdt-logs subdirectory. If none of these locations are writable, the logging framework prints an error message to stderr and exits.\nConsole output WDT tools output logging information to stdout and stderr, as appropriate. By default, only INFO level messages are sent to stdout. All WARNING and SEVERE messages are set to stderr. In addition to regular log messages generated as the tool runs, the tools will produce a summary at the end of tool execution that gives the user an overview of the tool execution status. For example, the validateModel tool execution with no warnings or errors will produce output that looks similar to this:\nIssue Log for validateModel version 2.0.0 running WebLogic version 12.2.1.4.0.210930 offline mode: Total: WARNING : 0 SEVERE : 0 Logging levels As mentioned previously, WDT’s logging framework is based on java.util.logging so all logging levels defined in the java.utiul.logging.Level class apply to WDT loggers. For a quick review of those levels, see the javadoc .\nWDT uses hierarchical loggers that align with the purpose of the code being executed. The root logger is named wlsdeploy. Many loggers exist underneath the root logger; for example, wlsdeploy.create, wlsdeploy.discover, and wlsdeploy.util. By default, the WDT logging.properties file sets the logging level of the root and several important loggers. If the level for a particular logger is not set, that logger will use the level of its parent logger. This delegation to the parent logger is recursive up the hierarchy until it finds a level to use.\nIn WDT, the log file will collect log entries from all loggers based on the logger’s level while the console output is limited to INFO and above only. Log entries written to the console will not display any exception stack traces associated with a log entry. To see those, you must look at the log file. The WDT logging framework supports using the wlsdeploy.debugToStdout Java system property to allow debug log messages (those logged at the FINE level or below) to appear in stdout as long as the loggers to which the messages are logged are not filtering those log levels. For example, doing the following will cause debug output to be written to the console:\nexport WLSDEPLOY_PROPERTIES=-Dwlsdeploy.debugToStdout=true weblogic-deploy/bin/prepareModel.sh ... Log handlers WDT uses several log handlers to handle logging output of data to various sources.\nLog Handler Output Destination Description java.util.logging.FileHandler WDT tool log file The standard java.util.logging file handler. oracle.weblogic.deploy.logging.StdoutHandler stdout WDT handler that writes INFO level messages to the console. oracle.weblogic.deploy.logging.StderrHandler stderr WDT handler that writes WARNING and SEVERE level messages to the console. oracle.weblogic.deploy.tooling.SummaryHandler stdout WDT handler that writes the tool’s execution summary information to the console. By default, all four handlers are used and configured appropriately. The logging framework intentionally limits the configurability of these handlers. Only the following logging.properties file settings are allowed.\nProperty Value(s) Allowed Behavior When Set handlers comma-separated list of handlers The list of handlers to use (removing a handler from the list is the same as setting its level property to OFF). java.util.logging.FileHandler.level OFF No logging output will be saved in the log file. oracle.weblogic.deploy.logging.StdoutHandler.level OFF No INFO level logging output will be written to the console. oracle.weblogic.deploy.logging.StderrHandler.level OFF No WARNING or ERROR level logging output will be written to the console. oracle.weblogic.deploy.logging.SummaryHandler.level OFF No tool execution summary output will be written to the console. oracle.weblogic.deploy.logging.SummaryHandler.size Any number Limits the number of memory-buffered WARNING and ERROR log records (default is 3000). Use the WLSDEPLOY_LOG_HANDLERS environment variable as an alternative to specifying the list of handlers in the logging.properties file’s handlers property.\nAny attempts to set other configuration for these log handlers will simply be discarded by the WDT logging framework at startup.",

    "content": "Contents Overview Specifying a target environment Pre-configured target environments Using secret credentials in the model Merging content from the WDT model Target configuration files Overview The Discover Domain and Prepare Model Tools allow you to customize the model and other files produced to be compatible with a specific target environment. Options for a target environment may include:\nUsing model tokens for some attributes in the model. For more details, see Model tokens . Using Kubernetes secrets for credentials in the model. For more details, see Using secret credentials in the model . Applying filters to the model. For more details, see Model filters . Creating additional configuration files for the target system. Specifying a target environment Each tool specifies a target environment using the command-line argument -target \u003ctarget-name\u003e, where \u003ctarget-name\u003e refers to a pre-configured target environment, or a user-defined environment. In addition, the -output_dir \u003coutput-directory\u003e argument specifies where the files for the target environment will be stored.\nThis command line shows how you can use these arguments with the Discover Domain Tool:\n$ $WLSDEPLOY_HOME/bin/discoverDomain.sh ... -target k8s -output_dir /etc/files This example would apply the k8s target type to the discovery result, and place those files in /etc/files.\nIf a variable file is specified on the tool’s command line using the -variable_file argument, any injected variables will be added to that file. If no variable file is specified, injected variables will be written to the file \u003coutput-directory\u003e/\u003ctarget_name\u003e_variable.properties.\nPre-configured target environments These target environment configurations are included in the WebLogic Deploy Tooling installation.\nThe WebLogic Kubernetes Operator targets You can use these targets to customize the model and create a domain resource file for use with WebLogic Kubernetes Operator (WKO). There are three targets for specific domain home source types :\nwko and wko\u003cversion\u003e for Model in Image deployments wko-dii and wko\u003cversion\u003e-dii for Domain in Image deployments wko-pvand wko\u003cversion\u003e-pv for Domain in PV deployments The value of \u003cversion\u003e corresponds to a major version of WKO. For example the target wko4-dii would customize the model for a Domain in Image deployment for WKO version 4.0.0 and later.\nTargets without a version number, such as wko-dii, will customize the model for the current version of WKO. This association may change as new versions of WKO are released, so it is recommended to use target names with the intended WKO version.\nEach of these targets provides this additional processing:\nThe wko_filter filter will be applied to remove model elements that are not compatible with the Kubernetes environment, and adjust some attribute values Variables will be injected into the model for port, host, and URL attributes lax validation will be applied for the resulting model An additional Kubernetes resource file, wko-domain.yaml, will be produced, with cluster and naming information derived from the model In addition, the wko target will replace credentials in the model with references to Kubernetes secrets, and produce a script to create those secrets. The wko-dii and wko-pv targets will replace credentials in the model with variable references.\nGeneric Kubernetes target You can apply this target environment by providing the command-line argument -target k8s. It will provide this additional processing:\nThe k8s_filter filter will be applied to remove model elements that are not compatible with the Kubernetes environment, and adjust some attribute values Variables will be injected into the model for port, host, and URL attributes lax validation will be applied for the resulting model Credentials in the model will be replaced with references to Kubernetes secrets, and a script to create those secrets will be produced Using secret credentials in the model If a target environment is configured to use Kubernetes secrets for credential attribute values, each of those values is replaced with a token using the format @@SECRET:@@ENV:DOMAIN_UID@@\u003csecret-suffix\u003e:\u003ckey\u003e. For example:\nPasswordEncrypted: '@@SECRET:@@ENV:DOMAIN_UID@@-jdbc-generic1:password@@' When a domain is created or updated using a model with these tokens, the environment variable DOMAIN_UID should be set to the domain’s UID, and secrets with corresponding names should have been created. For more details about using secret tokens, see Model Tokens .\nFor some target environments, the WebLogic admin credentials use a variation of this token format. For example:\ndomainInfo: AdminUserName: '@@SECRET:__weblogic-credentials__:username@@' AdminPassword: '@@SECRET:__weblogic-credentials__:password@@' In this case, the token __weblogic-credentials__ allows these attributes to reference secrets in a specific location. The WDT_MODEL_SECRETS_NAME_DIR_PAIRS environment variable should be set to associate __weblogic-credentials__ to this location. For example:\nWDT_MODEL_SECRETS_NAME_DIR_PAIRS=__weblogic-credentials__=/etc/my-secrets For more details about using the WDT_MODEL_SECRETS_NAME_DIR_PAIRS environment variable, see Model Tokens .\nIn WebLogic Kubernetes Operator Model in Image environments, the environment variable DOMAIN_UID is automatically set from the value in the domain resource file. The variable WDT_MODEL_SECRETS_NAME_DIR_PAIRS is automatically set to the directory containing WebLogic admin credentials.\nThe create secrets script For target environments that use Kubernetes secret tokens, a shell script is created to generate the required secrets. The script is named create_k8s_secrets.sh, and is created in the target output directory. The script has commands to create each secret, for example:\n# Update \u003cuser\u003e and \u003cpassword\u003e for weblogic-credentials create_paired_k8s_secret weblogic-credentials \u003cuser\u003e \u003cpassword\u003e The script should be updated with correct \u003cuser\u003e and \u003cpassword\u003e values as required. It may be necessary to change the NAMESPACE and DOMAIN_UID variables at the top of the script if they are different in the target environment.\nThe script performs a check to determine if any generated secret names are more than 63 characters in length, because that will prevent them from being mounted correctly in the Kubernetes environment. If any secret names exceed this limit, they will need to be shortened in this script, in the model files, and in the Kubernetes resource file. Each shortened name should be distinct from other secret names.\nMerging content from the WDT model When a Kubernetes custom resource definition (CRD) file is created for a target environment, content from the corresponding section of the WDT model will be merged into the resulting output, if that section is present.\nFor example, when the -target wko option is used, content from the kubernetes section of the WDT model will be merged into the resulting CRD, if that section is present. For example, you can define this section in the model:\nkubernetes: spec: domainHome: /etc/domainHome image: my-image clusters: - clusterName: my-cluster replicas: 4 - clusterName: other-cluster replicas: 6 These fields will override the values in the output file, and the file would be rewritten with the revised values. List values in the model will be combined with existing values in the output file. For example, if my-cluster was in the original output file, the model content for my-cluster would be merged with it, overriding the replicas value. If my-cluster was not in the original output file, it would be added to the list of clusters.\nWhen creating a resource file for WebLogic Kubernetes Operator version 4.0.0 and later, the kubernetes section of the model has to be structured differently. This is because there are multiple documents in the resource file for those versions. This example uses domain and cluster folders that will merge with the corresponding documents in the resource file:\nkubernetes: domain: spec: domainHome: /etc/domainHome image: my-image clusters: - spec: clusterName: my-cluster replicas: 4 - spec: clusterName: other-cluster replicas: 6 Target environment configuration files A target environment is configured in a JSON file at this location:\n$WLSDEPLOY_HOME/lib/targets/\u003ctarget-name\u003e/target.json The \u003ctarget-name\u003e value corresponds to the value of the -target argument on the tool’s command line. The WLS installation includes pre-defined targets for these environments:\nWebLogic Kubernetes Operator Kubernetes You can define a new or extended target environment with a new target-name in the above location, or using a Custom configuration directory, such as $WDT_CUSTOM_CONFIG/target/\u003cmy-target-name\u003e/target.json.\nYou can customize existing template files for specific environments. The recommended method is to copy the original template to a custom configuration directory as described above, such as $WDT_CUSTOM_CONFIG/target/\u003ctarget-name\u003e/model.yaml. The copied file can then be edited as needed, while maintaining the original for reference.\nHere is an example of a target environment file:\n{ \"model_filters\" : { \"discover\": [ { \"name\": \"wko_prep\", \"path\": \"@@TARGET_CONFIG_DIR@@/wko_operator_filter.py\" }, { \"id\": \"wko_filter\" } ] }, \"variable_injectors\" : {\"PORT\": {},\"HOST\": {},\"URL\": {}}, \"validation_method\" : \"lax\", \"credentials_method\" : \"secrets\", \"exclude_domain_bin_contents\": true, \"wls_credentials_name\" : \"__weblogic-credentials__\", \"use_persistent_volume\" : true, \"additional_secrets\": \"runtime-encryption-secret\", \"additional_output\" : \"wko-domain.yaml\" } Each of the fields in this example is optional, and you can customize them.\nmodel_filters This field specifies the filters to be applied to the resulting model. This follows the same format and rules as the Model filters configuration. The discover type should always be used here.\nYou can use the @@TARGET_CONFIG_DIR@@ token to indicate that the specified filter is in the same directory as the target configuration file.\nvariable_injectors This field specifies the variable injectors to be applied to the resulting model. This follows the same format and rules as the Variable injectors configuration.\nvalidation_method You can use this field to set the validation level for the resulting model. Only the value laxis currently supported. With lax validation, variables and Kubernetes secrets referenced in the resulting model do not need to be available when the model is created.\ncredentials_method This field specifies how credentials in the model should be handled. There are two values available:\nsecrets - the credentials in the model are replaced with references to Kubernetes secrets, and a UNIX script to create those secrets is produced. config_override_secrets - the credentials in the model are replaced with placeholder values, such as password1, and a UNIX script to create corresponding Kubernetes secrets is produced. In both these cases, the script to create the Kubernetes secrets is written to \u003coutput-directory\u003e/create_k8s_secrets.sh. You will need to update this script with credential values before executing\nexclude_domain_bin_contents This field specifies how the domain’s bin directory contents should be handled. If set to true, then discovery will skip over the domain’s bin directory resulting in a model and archive file without any references to any scripts that might typically be collected (for example, setUserOverrides.sh).\nwls_credentials_name This field specifies a name for use with the WDT_MODEL_SECRETS_NAME_DIR_PAIRS environment variable to identify administration credential Secrets for the domain. This is useful when those Secrets are stored in a directory that does not follow the \u003cdirectory\u003e/\u003cname\u003e/\u003ckey\u003e convention. For more information about using the WDT_MODEL_SECRETS_NAME_DIR_PAIRS environment variable, see Model tokens .\nuse_persistent_volume This field specifies if the domain is to be created for the Domain in PV domain home source type . If set to true, volume information will be added to the Kubernetes resource file that is generated.\nadditional_secrets This field specifies a comma-separated list of secret types that are to be included in the Kubernetes resource file and the create secrets script. There is one secret type available:\nruntime-encryption-secret - this will add a runtimeEncryptionSecret attribute to the Kubernetes resource file with the value \u003cDOMAIN_UID\u003e-runtime-encryption-secret, and that secret name will be added to the create secrets script . additional_output You can use this field to create additional output for use in the target environment. The value is a comma-separated list of template files in the $WLSDEPLOY_HOME/lib/targets/templates directory. These templates are populated with information derived from the model, and written to a file with the same name in the specified output directory.\nNote: Prior to release 2.0.1, template files were stored in the $WLSDEPLOY_HOME/lib/targets/\u003ctarget-name\u003e directory.",

See Advance use cases .\nCreating a new domain to connect to an existing RCU schema If you ever find a situation where your JRF domain home directory is corrupted or lost, it is possible to create a new domain home directory using the existing RCU schemas provided that you have previously exported the domain’s encryption key into an Oracle wallet. To export the encryption key into a wallet, use the OPSS WLST offline exportEncryptionKey function.\nWhen you want to recreate the JRF domain home, you have two options:\nUse the Create Domain tool’s -opss_wallet \u003cpath-to-wallet-file\u003e argument and one of the following arguments to pass the wallet passphrase:\n-opss_wallet_passphrase_env \u003cenvironment-variable-name\u003e - Simply pass the name of the environment variable to read to get the wallet passphrase. -opss_wallet_passphrase_file \u003cpath-to-file\u003e - Simply pass the file name for the file containing the wallet passphrase. Add the OPSS wallet to the archive file in the prescribed location (i.e., wlsdeploy/opsswallet/) using the Archive Helper tool’s add opssWallet command and then provide the passphrase in the domainInfo section’s OPSSWalletPassphrase field.\ndomainInfo: OPSSWalletPassphrase: MySecureOPSSWalletPassphrase Using wallets to access the RCU database The term wallet can refer to either an Oracle PKI-created wallet file such as cwallet.sso or ewallet.p12 or a bundle of files used to establish the database connection such as the contents of the ZIP file downloaded from an OCI ATP database. In WDT, the term wallet is simply a location where one or more files related to connecting to the database can be stored.\nThe Archive Helper Tool supports adding database wallets to the archive using the add databaseWallet -wallet_name \u003cname\u003e. The standard name of the wallet used for the RCU database is rcu and the Archive Helper Tool provides a shortcut for adding the files by using the add rcuWallet command. WDT supports adding one or more files to an archive-stored wallet directory by:\nAdding one or more files directly, or Adding a single ZIP file containing the files (such as one downloaded from an ATP database). If the archive wallet contains a single ZIP file, the ZIP file will be automatically extracted when WDT extracts it from the archive file.\nPlease obtain the necessary wallet file(s) from your DBA.\nUsing a tnsnames.ora file instead of the database connection string When accessing an Oracle database for the RCU schemas, you can use a tnsnames.ora file to specify the database connection string. Instead of specifying the rcu_db_conn_string explicitly, do one of the following:\nPlace the tnsnames.ora file in the rcu wallet inside the archive file, or Set the oracle.net.tns_admin attribute to point to the path to the directory where the tnsnames.ora file resides.\nThis may either be a relative path from the domain directory (which may be the path into the archive such as config/wlsdeploy/dbWallets/myWallet) or an absolute path. In both cases, the tns.alias attribute must be set. The tns.alias is the network service name of an entry inside the tnsnames.ora file. The alias is on the left side and the connect string is on the right side of the equals sign.\nxxxx = (DESCRIPTION ...) yyyy = (DESCRIPTION ...) ... WDT will parse the tnsnames.ora file to find the connect string that matches the specified tns.alias to obtain the RCU database connect string.\nAccess a database using SSL connections When accessing an Oracle database using a TLS connection (such as an oracle_database_connection_type of ATP or SSL), the database may use ONE_WAY or TWO_WAY (also known as mutual TLS or simply mTLS) SSL.\nFor ONE_WAY SSL, the connection requires only a “trust store”; that is, a keystore that contains the Certificate Authority’s (CA) certificate used to sign the database server’s certificate. This trust store is used by the database client to determine whether it trusts the certificate presented by the database server during the SSL handshake.\nWhen using TWO_WAY SSL, the connection requires both a “trust store” and an “identity store”; that is, a certificate that the database client presents to the database server during the SSL handshake.\nIn the RCUDbInfo section, the trust and identity stores are specified using the following attributes.\nTrust Store javax.net.ssl.trustStore - The key store file to use as the trust store. This may be a relative path from the domain home (for example, the path into the archive such as config/wlsdeploy/dbWallets/rcu/truststore.jks) or the absolute path to the key store file. javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType - The key store type (JKS, PKCS12, or SSO). javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword - The passphrase used to open the key store file, if required. Identity Store javax.net.ssl.keyStore - The key store file to use as the trust store. This may be a relative path from the domain home (for example, the path into the archive such as config/wlsdeploy/dbWallets/rcu/keystore.jks) or the absolute path to the key store file. javax.net.ssl.keyStoreType - The key store type (JKS, PKCS12, or SSO). javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword - The passphrase used to open the key store file, if required. Depending on the type of database and the SSL connection type, you can provide the necessary information with RCUDbInfo in the model.\nExamples The following examples represent how to specify the RCUDbInfo parameters for connecting to an RCU database.\nATP database ATP databases can use either ONE_WAY or TWO_WAY SSL. See the Access a database using SSL connections for more details on which fields are relevant for your ATP database configuration.\nFor example, to use the Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing Cloud Database for a JRF domain, specify the following information in the model:\ndomainInfo: RCUDbInfo: oracle_database_connection_type : 'ATP' rcu_db_conn_string: \u003cURL string, optional if using tnsnames.ora\u003e rcu_prefix : DEV rcu_admin_user : admin # only required when you specify the `-run_rcu` flag rcu_admin_password: \u003cdatabase admin password\u003e # only required when you specify the `-run_rcu` flag rcu_schema_password : \u003cRCU schema password\u003e oracle.net.tns_admin: \u003coptional path to the wallet directory containing the tnsnames.ora file\u003e tns.alias : \u003calias of ATP db in the tnsnames.ora file\u003e javax.net.ssl.keyStore: \u003carchive path or absolute path to the identity key store if using mTLS\u003e javax.net.ssl.keyStoreType: \u003cthe identity key store type (JKS, SSO, or PKCS12) if using mTLS\u003e javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword : \u003cthe identity key store password when generating the wallet from Oracle Cloud Console if using mTLS and not using an SSO wallet as the key store\u003e javax.net.ssl.trustStore: \u003carchive path or absolute path to the trust key store\u003e javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType: \u003cthe trust key store type (JKS, SSO, or PKCS12)\u003e javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword : \u003cthe trust key store password when generating the wallet from Oracle Cloud Console if not using an SSO wallet as the trust key store\u003e The database wallet downloaded from the ATP database can be included in the archive file as a named entry (example uses rcu as that name) under thedbWallets archive structure, either as a ZIP file:\nwlsdeploy/dbWallets/rcu/Walletxyz.zip\nor as the unzipped contents:\nwlsdeploy/dbWallets/rcu/cwallet.sso wlsdeploy/dbWallets/rcu/ewallet.p12 wlsdeploy/dbWallets/rcu/ewallet.pem wlsdeploy/dbWallets/rcu/keystore.jks wlsdeploy/dbWallets/rcu/ojdbc.properties wlsdeploy/dbWallets/rcu/sqlnet.ora wlsdeploy/dbWallets/rcu/tnsnames.ora wlsdeploy/dbWallets/rcu/truststore.jks At runtime, WDT will extract the files (if they are in a ZIP file) to $DOMAIN_HOME/wlsdeploy/dbWallets/rcu/ so that they can be referenced directly from the model using the normal relative path. For example:\nOracle database using an SSL connection Other Oracle databases can use either ONE_WAY or TWO_WAY SSL. See the Access a database using SSL connections for more details on which fields are relevant for your database configuration.\nFor an Oracle SSL database with TWO_WAY SSL enabled, with an SSO wallet, use the following example:\ndomainInfo: RCUDbInfo: oracle_database_connection_type : 'SSL' rcu_db_conn_string: \u003cURL string, optional if using tnsnames.ora\u003e rcu_prefix : DEV rcu_admin_password: \u003crequired with -run_rcu flag\u003e rcu_schema_password: \u003crequired\u003e oracle.net.tns_admin: \u003coptional path to the wallet directory containing the tnsnames.ora file\u003e tns.alias: \u003calias of ssl db in the tnsnames.ora file\u003e javax.net.ssl.keyStore: \u003cpath to the SSO wallet with the identity certificate; for example, config/wlsdeploy/dbWallets/rcu/cwallet.sso\u003e javax.net.ssl.keyStoreType: SSO javax.net,ssl.trustStore: \u003cpath to the SSO wallet with the trust CA certificate; for example, config/wlsdeploy/dbWallets/rcu/cwallet.sso\u003e javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType: SSO For an Oracle SSL database with ONE_WAY SSL enabled, with an SSO wallet, use the following example:\ndomainInfo: RCUDbInfo: databaseType : 'SSL' rcu_prefix : DEV rcu_db_conn_string: \u003cURL string, optional if using tnsnames.ora\u003e rcu_admin_password: \u003crequired with -run_rcu flag\u003e rcu_schema_password: \u003crequired\u003e oracle.net.tns_admin: \u003coptional path to the wallet directory containing the tnsnames.ora file\u003e tns.alias: \u003calias of ssl db in the tnsnames.ora file\u003e javax.net,ssl.trustStore: \u003cpath to the SSO wallet with the trust CA certificate; for example, config/wlsdeploy/dbWallets/rcu/cwallet.sso\u003e javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType: SSO SSL database using Oracle PKI PKCS12 wallets For an Oracle SSL database with TW0_WAY SSL enabled, with an Oracle PKI PKCS12 wallet, use the following example:\ndomainInfo: RCUDbInfo: databaseType : 'SSL' rcu_db_conn_string: \u003cURL string, optional if using tnsnames.ora\u003e rcu_prefix : DEV rcu_admin_password: \u003crequired with -run_rcu flag\u003e rcu_schema_password: \u003crequired\u003e oracle.net.tns_admin: \u003coptional path to the wallet directory containing the tnsnames.ora file\u003e tns.alias: \u003calias of ssl db in the tnsnames.ora file\u003e javax.net.ssl.keyStore: \u003cpath to the PKCS12 keystore with the identity certificate; for example, config/wlsdeploy/dbWallets/rcu/ewallet.p12\u003e javax.net.ssl.keyStoreType: PKCS12 javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword: \u003ckeystore password\u003e javax.net.ssl.trustStore: \u003cpath to the PKCS12 keystore with the trust CA certificate; for example, config/wlsdeploy/dbWallets/rcu/ewallet.p12\u003e javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType: PKCS12 javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword: \u003ctruststore password\u003e For an Oracle SSL database with ONE_WAY SSL enabled, with a PKCS12 wallet, use the following example:\ndomainInfo: RCUDbInfo: databaseType : 'SSL' rcu_db_conn_string: \u003cURL string, optional if using tnsnames.ora\u003e rcu_prefix : DEV rcu_admin_password: \u003crequired with -run_rcu flag\u003e rcu_schema_password: \u003crequired\u003e oracle.net.tns_admin: \u003coptional path to the wallet directory containing the tnsnames.ora file\u003e tns.alias: \u003calias of ssl db in the tnsnames.ora file\u003e javax.net.ssl.trustStore: \u003ctruststore found in the unzipped wallet; for example, config/wlsdeploy/dbWallets/rcu/ewallet.p12\u003e javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType: PKCS12 javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword: \u003cpassword of the truststore\u003e When using an Oracle PKI-generated PKCS12 wallet, you must include the Oracle PKI provider to access your wallet. Add the Oracle PKI provider to your Java java.security file. For more information, see Section 2.2.4 “How can Oracle wallets be used in Java” in SSL with Oracle JDBC Thin Driver .\nAccess a database without using a wallet For a typical database, use the following example:\ndomainInfo: RCUDbInfo: rcu_prefix : DEV # Optional rcu_admin_user for creating RCU schema if -run_rcu flag is specified. Default user is SYS if not specified. # This user must have SYSDBA privilege and this is the equivalent of -dbUser in the RCU utility. rcu_admin_user: superuser rcu_admin_password : \u003crequired with -run_rcu flag\u003e rcu_schema_password : \u003crcu schema password\u003e rcu_db_conn_string : dbhost:1521/pdborcl Specify variables for RCU RCU -variables option of the repository creation utility can now be included in the RCUDbInfo section with the key rcu_variables:\ndomainInfo: RCUDbInfo: rcu_variables : xxxx Specify extended XML files for RCU When creating a domain using WDT and the -run_rcu option, you can specify your extended XML files in the RCUDbInfo section.\nThis correlates to the createRepository and dropRepository command-line arguments RCU -compInfoXMLLocation \u003cfile path\u003e -storageXMLLocation \u003cfile path\u003e.\nInclude your XML files in your archive file using the location wlsdeploy/custom/rcu/config.

    "content": "Note To meet Oracle’s security standards, the encryption algorithms require later versions of JDK 7, JDK 8, or newer to run.\nModels contain WebLogic Server domain configuration. Certain types of resources and other configurations require passwords; for example, a JDBC data source requires the password for the user establishing the database connection. When creating or configuring a resource that requires a password, that password must be specified either in the model directly or in the variable file. Clear-text passwords are not conducive to storing configurations as source, so the Encrypt Model Tool gives the model author the ability to encrypt the passwords in the model and variable file using passphrase-based, reversible encryption. When using a tool with a model containing encrypted passwords, the encryption passphrase must be provided, so that the tool can decrypt the password in memory to set the necessary WebLogic Server configuration (which supports its own encryption mechanism based on a domain-specific key). While there is no requirement to use the WebLogic Deploy Tooling encryption mechanism, it is highly recommended because storing clear-text passwords on disk is never a good idea.\nThe Create Domain, Update Domain, and Deploy Applications Tools can take a set of models. The Encrypt model will encrypt a set of models. Each model is encrypted using the same passphrase and written back to its original location.\nNote WebLogic Deploy Tooling also supports the use of domain-encrypted passwords directly in the model. The Encrypt Model Tool cannot be used in tandem with this method.\nStart with the following example model:\ndomainInfo: AdminUserName: weblogic AdminPassword: welcome1 ServerStartMode: prod topology: Name: DemoDomain SecurityConfiguration: NodeManagerUsername: weblogic NodeManagerPasswordEncrypted: welcome1 Security: Group: FriscoGroup: Description: The WLS Deploy development group User: Robert: Password: welcome1 GroupMemberOf: [ Administrators, FriscoGroup ] Derek: Password: welcome1 GroupMemberOf: 'Administrators, FriscoGroup' Richard: Password: welcome1 GroupMemberOf: [ FriscoGroup ] Carolyn: Password: welcome1 GroupMemberOf: FriscoGroup Mike: Password: welcome1 GroupMemberOf: FriscoGroup Johnny: Password: welcome1 GroupMemberOf: FriscoGroup Gopi: Password: welcome1 GroupMemberOf: FriscoGroup To run the Encrypt Model Tool on the model, run the following command:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\encryptModel.cmd -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -model_file UnencryptedDemoDomain.yaml The tool will prompt for the encryption passphrase twice and then encrypt any passwords it finds in the model, skipping any password fields that have variable values, to produce a result that looks like the following model. You can bypass the stdin prompt with two other options. Store the passphrase in an environment variable, and use the environment variable name with command-line option -passphrase_env. Another option is to create a file containing the passphrase value. Pass this filename using the command-line option -passphrase_file.\ndomainInfo: AdminUserName: weblogic AdminPassword: '{AES}a0dacEQ4Q2JnTmI4VHp5NjIzVHNPRFg5ZjRiVDJ4NzU6T1M0SGYwM2xBeHdRdHFWVTpWZEh6bkd4NzZSQT0=' ServerStartMode: prod topology: Name: DemoDomain SecurityConfiguration: NodeManagerUsername: weblogic NodeManagerPasswordEncrypted: '{AES}WndJQWNySWpoY0VEbFpmR2V1RFhvamVFdGwzandtaFU6L1d4V0dPRFpsaXJIUkl2djpQdUdLaTloR1IxTT0=' Security: Group: FriscoGroup: Description: The WebLogic Deploy development group User: Robert: Password: '{AES}VFIzVmdwcWNLeHBPaWhyRy82VER6WFV6aHRPbGcwMjQ6bS90OGVSTnJxWTIvZjkrRjpjSzBQUHlOWWpWTT0=' GroupMemberOf: [ Administrators, FriscoGroup ] Derek: Password: '{AES}R1BTM21ZSkxpdTNIZjNqcTlsSC9PeHV4aXJoT3kxazM6M1dLOXBLeCtlc1lsVDUrWjo5VitHZUxCcjZnOD0=' GroupMemberOf: 'Administrators, FriscoGroup' Richard: Password: '{AES}Y3FkQmRIRGhjZEtlRjVkVVdLQU1Eb09LWDIzMlhUWVo6MjllVExsMmNmNzJzZDFjaTpNcVNDbUs2cnRFRT0=' GroupMemberOf: [ FriscoGroup ] Carolyn: Password: '{AES}cW8wczJqZXJZOHVsTGNOTmlqTGpuZGFoSkY2ME5WbTk6c0VaWGs1ME5pemlKdC9wajpFaTJPRS9ZQlcvND0=' GroupMemberOf: FriscoGroup Mike: Password: '{AES}cnF6Z3JOVWcvc0czN3JVb1g5T2FidmRsSU51anJCa0Y6UlBsNVFsOFlXU29xUlY1aDp3VWZWYU5VOVRkMD0=' GroupMemberOf: FriscoGroup Johnny: Password: '{AES}UWJ5Y25Ma2RHTkNMVTZ1RnlhRkNaTUxXaXV4SjBjaWg6citwTDQvelN1aUlPdnZaSDpCMEdSWGg2ZlVJUT0=' GroupMemberOf: FriscoGroup Gopi: Password: '{AES}MWJGcnhtZlNyWXVrU1VXMVFxZFEvQThoS1hPN2FQdDc6MmRPaUF2Y1FCQ3VIK3MydDpZaFR5clBrN1FjOD0=' GroupMemberOf: FriscoGroup If the model stores passwords in the variables file, like the following model:\nresources: JDBCSystemResource: Generic1: Target: mycluster JdbcResource: JDBCDataSourceParams: JNDIName: [ jdbc/generic1 ] GlobalTransactionsProtocol: TwoPhaseCommit JDBCDriverParams: DriverName: oracle.jdbc.xa.client.OracleXADataSource URL: 'jdbc:oracle:thin:@//@@PROP:db.url@@' PasswordEncrypted: '@@PROP:db.password@@' Properties: user: Value: '@@PROP:db.user@@' oracle.net.CONNECT_TIMEOUT: Value: 5000 oracle.jdbc.ReadTimeout: Value: 30000 JDBCConnectionPoolParams: InitialCapacity: 3 MaxCapacity: 15 TestTableName: SQL ISVALID TestConnectionsOnReserve: true MailSession: MyMailSession: JNDIName: mail/MyMailSession Target: mycluster SessionUsername: john.smith@example.com SessionPasswordEncrypted: '@@PROP:mymailsession.password@@' Properties: mail.store.protocol: imap mail.imap.port: 993 mail.imap.ssl.enable: true mail.imap.starttls.enable: true mail.imap.host: imap.example.com mail.impa.auth: true mail.transport.protocol: smtp mail.smtp.starttls.enable: true mail.smtp.port: 465 mail.smtp.ssl.enable: true mail.smtp.auth: true mail.smtp.host: smtp.example.com Run the Encrypt Model Tool and pass both the model and variable files, like this:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\encryptModel.cmd -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -model_file UnencryptedDemoDomain.yaml -variable_file UnencryptedDemoDomain.properties The variable file will now look something like the following:\n#Variables updated after encryption #Thu Feb 01 19:12:57 CST 2018 db.user=rpatrick db.url=mydb.example.com:1539/PDBORCL db.password={AES}czFXMkNFWNG9jNTNYd0hRL2R1anBnb0hDUlp4K1liQWFBdVM4UTlvMnE0NU1aMUZ5UVhiK25oaWFBc2lIQ20\\= mymailsession.password={AES}RW9nRnUzcE41WGNMdnEzNDdRQVVNWm1LMGhidkFBVXg6OUN3aXcyci82cmh3cnpNQTpmY2UycUp5YWl4UT0\\= Environment variables The following environment variables may be set.\nJAVA_HOME The location of the JDK.

    "content": "WebLogic Server security configuration requires special handling and causes the need for the model semantics to differ from other folders. Because provider ordering is important, and to make sure that the ordering is correctly set in the newly created domain, the Create Domain Tool and Update Domain Tool require that all providers be specified in the model for any provider type that will be created or altered. For example, if you want to change one of the providers in the provider type AuthenticationProvider, your model must specify all of the AuthenticationProvider providers and any non-default attributes for those providers. In order to apply security providers, these tools will delete all providers from the target domain for those provider types specified in the model before adding the providers from the model to the target domain. Provider types that are omitted from the model will be unchanged. Example provider types are Adjudicator, AuthenticationProvider, Authorizer, CertPathProvider, CredentialMapper, PasswordValidator, and RoleMapper.\nFor example, if the model specified an LDAPAuthenticator and an LDAPX509IdentityAsserter similar to what is shown below, the DefaultAuthenticator and DefaultIdentityAsserter would be deleted. In this example, other provider types like RoleMapper and CredentialMapper are not specified and would be left untouched by the tools.\ntopology: SecurityConfiguration: Realm: myrealm: AuthenticationProvider: My LDAP authenticator: LDAPAuthenticator: ControlFlag: SUFFICIENT PropagateCauseForLoginException: true EnableGroupMembershipLookupHierarchyCaching: true Host: myldap.example.com Port: 389 UserObjectClass: person GroupHierarchyCacheTTL: 600 SSLEnabled: true UserNameAttribute: cn Principal: 'cn=foo,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com' UserBaseDn: 'OU=Users,DC=example,DC=com' UserSearchScope: subtree UserFromNameFilter: '(\u0026(cn=%u)(objectclass=person))' AllUsersFilter: '(memberOf=CN=foo,OU=mygroups,DC=example,DC=com)' GroupBaseDN: 'OU=mygroups,DC=example,DC=com' AllGroupsFilter: '(\u0026(foo)(objectclass=group))' StaticGroupObjectClass: group StaticMemberDNAttribute: cn StaticGroupDNsfromMemberDNFilter: '(\u0026(member=%M)(objectclass=group))' DynamicGroupObjectClass: group DynamicGroupNameAttribute: cn UseRetrievedUserNameAsPrincipal: true KeepAliveEnabled: true GuidAttribute: uuid My LDAP IdentityAsserter: LDAPX509IdentityAsserter: ActiveType: AuthenticatedUser Host: myldap.example.com Port: 389 SSLEnabled: true In order to keep the DefaultAuthenticator and DefaultIdentityAsserter while changing/adding providers, they must be specified in the model with any non-default attributes as shown in the example below.

Before you can configure this asserter with WLST offline or WDT offline, you must first build the schema file using the prepareCustomProvider script.\nHere is an example of how to prepare and install a schema file from its MBean Jar File (MJF):\n$ export CONFIG_JVM_ARGS=-DSchemaTypeSystemName=TrustServiceIdentityAsserter $ ORACLE_HOME/oracle_common/common/bin/prepareCustomProvider.sh -mjf=ORACLE_HOME/oracle_common/modules/oracle.jps/jps-wls-trustprovider.jar -out ORACLE_HOME/oracle_common/lib/schematypes/jps-wls-trustprovider.schema.jar For FMW versions 12.1.2 and 12.1.3, replace oracle.jps in the example path above with: oracle.jps_12.1.2, or oracle.jps_12.1.3, respectively.\nCustom security providers Note Creating and updating domains with custom security providers is limited to WebLogic version 12.1.2 and newer.\nPrior to using this tooling to create or update a domain with a custom security provider, there are several prerequisites. First, WebLogic Server requires the custom MBean JAR to be in the Oracle Home directory before it can be configured, WLSERVER/server/lib/mbeantypes. Second, WebLogic Scripting Tool, WLST, requires that the schema JAR be placed in the Oracle Home directory before WLST offline can be used to discover it or configure it, ORACLEHOME/oracle_common/lib/schematypes. Generating an MBean JAR documentation can be found in the WebLogic Server documentation . Generating the schema JAR can be done with the prepareCustomProvider script provided in the WebLogic Server installation.\nFor the MBean JAR, WLST offline allows you to define an alternate directory other than WLSERVER/server/lib/mbeantypes by using the system property -Dfmwconfig.alternateTypesDirectory=dir. For the WebLogic MBean schema type JAR, you can use an alternate location by using -Dfmwconfig.alternateSchemaDirectory=dir. In order for the custom provider JARs to be loaded correctly by WLST offline when discovering or creating a domain, set this system property in the WLSDEPLOY_PROPERTIES environment variable. Both of the properties take a comma-separated list of paths to directories containing the corresponding type of jar.\nNote If you create a domain using the -Dfmwconfig.alternateTypesDirectory=dir and -Dfmwconfig.alternateSchemaDirectory=dir system properties, you will need to make sure to specify the -Dweblogic.alternateTypesDirectory=dir and -Dweblogic.alternateSchemaDirectory=dir system properties to the WebLogic Server servers’ startup environment. The Admin Server and all managed servers in the domain will require these properties to locate, load, and configure the custom security provider from these alternative locations.\nThe format for a custom security provider is slightly different from a built-in provider in that the custom provider must supply the fully-qualified name of the class for the provider in the model between the provider name and the attributes for that provider. Note that the generated Impl suffix is omitted from the name. In the custom CredentialMapper example below, note the location in the model of ’examples.security.providers.SampleCredentialMapper':\nCredentialMapper: Sample CredentialMapper: examples.security.providers.SampleCredentialMapper: UserNameMapperClassName: examples.security.providers.CredentialMapperProviderImpl CredentialMappingDeploymentEnabled: true Known limitations Adjudicator provider types cannot be added or modified due to a limitation in WLST. PasswordCredentials provider types cannot be updated in WLST online.",

The person running the release process must have admin privileges on the WebLogic Deploy Tooling GitHub repo because the release process pushes to the master branch directly. The person running the release process needs to create a GitHub Personal Access Token for the repository with (at least) the repo:status, repo_deployment, public_repo, and security_events privileges. The person running the release process needs a server added to their Maven settings.xml file, where the GitHub Personal Access Token is stored, as shown below. Note that this token can either be stored in plain text or encrypted using Maven password encryption . \u003cservers\u003e \u003cserver\u003e \u003cid\u003egithub\u003c/id\u003e \u003cpassphrase\u003estore plain text or encrypted token here\u003c/passphrase\u003e \u003c/server\u003e \u003c/servers\u003e If the machine from which the release process is being run requires a proxy server to access the Internet, the person running the release process needs an active proxy configured in their Maven settings.xml file. \u003cproxies\u003e \u003cproxy\u003e \u003cactive\u003etrue\u003c/active\u003e \u003cid\u003emy-proxy\u003c/id\u003e \u003cprotocol\u003ehttp\u003c/protocol\u003e \u003chost\u003eproxy server DNS name\u003c/host\u003e \u003cport\u003eproxy server port\u003c/port\u003e \u003cnonProxyHosts\u003elist of DNS names/patterns separated by |\u003c/nonProxyHosts\u003e \u003c/proxy\u003e \u003c/proxies\u003e Software release process The best practice is to write the release notes that will be published to GitHub prior to starting the steps below.\nSet (and export) the following environment variables:\nWLST_DIR - set to $MW_HOME/oracle_common/common/bin, where $MW_HOME is the path to a WLS 12.2.1.x or newer installation directory. WDT_SCM_REPO_URL - set to the browsable URL to the project (e.g., https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling) WDT_SCM_REPO_CONN - set to the clonable URL for the project (e.g., git@github.com:oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling.git) When releasing as part of the Oracle infrastructure, you must make sure to wait until all Jenkins build activity associated with the main branch is complete prior to starting the release process.\nIn the weblogic-deploy-tooling project directory, run the mvn -B release:prepare release:perform command.\nIf the next development version is changing the major or minor version, override the default developmentVersion property on the command line. For example,\nmvn -B -DdevelopmentVersion=3.2.0-SNAPSHOT release:prepare release:perform. If your SSH private key has a passphrase, watch the build closely because it will prompt for your passphrase multiple times. Failure to enter it in a timely manner may result in a failure. If the build fails, run the mvn -B release:rollback command to undo it and start over from Step 2., after correcting the issue.\nAfter the software has been released, move on to the GitHub Release Process.\nGitHub release process Note that this process relies on the WDT installers being in your local Maven repository. As such, it is critical for the same user to run these steps on the same machine as the steps from the previous section!\nPrior to starting the GitHub release, you must wait until all Jenkins activity triggered by the release is complete. Save the release notes in the file \u003cwdt-project-directory\u003e/target/ReleaseNotes.md. Run the command mvn -f github-release.xml -DreleaseVersion=\u003crelease version number\u003e verify to create the draft GitHub Release. Log into GitHub , go to the Releases page, review/edit the draft release, and then publish the release.",

    "content": "WebLogic Server has the ability to establish a set of users, groups, global roles, and policies as part of the WebLogic domain creation. The users and groups become part of the Embedded LDAP server (for example, DefaultAuthenticator) and are specified under topology in the Security section. The WebLogic global roles become part of the WebLogic role mapper (for example, XACMLRoleMapper) and are specified under domainInfo in the WLSRoles section. The WebLogic policies become part of the WebLogic authorizer (that is, XACMLAuthorizer).\nWebLogic users and groups The model allows for the definition of a set of users and groups that will be loaded into the WebLogic Embedded LDAP Server (for example, DefaultAuthenticator). New groups can be specified and users can be added as members of the new groups or existing groups, such as the Administrators group, which is defaulted to be in the WebLogic Admin global role. For additional information on users and groups, see Known Limitations .\nYou can specify the user password with a placeholder or encrypt it with the Encrypt Tool . An example Security section that adds an additional group AppMonitors, adds two new users and places the users into groups is shown in the example. You can add user attributes that are defined for the DefaultAuthenticator. This is a limited set of attributes that go under a separate folder UserAttribute in the model under the User section.\ntopology: Security: Group: AppMonitors: Description: Application Monitors User: john: Password: welcome1 GroupMemberOf: [ AppMonitors, Administrators ] joe: Password: welcome1 GroupMemberOf: [ AppMonitors ] UserAttribute: mail: joe@mycompany.com WebLogic global roles The model allows for the definition of WebLogic roles that can augment the well-known WebLogic global roles (for example, Admin, Deployer, Monitor, and such) in addition to defining new roles. When updating the well-known WebLogic roles, you can specify an UpdateMode as { append | prepend | replace } with the default being replace when not specified. Also, when updating the well-known roles, the specified Expression will be a logical OR with the default expression. The Expression value for the role is the same as when using the WebLogic RoleEditorMBean for a WebLogic security role mapping provider.\nFor example, the WLSRoles section below updates the well-known Admin, Deployer and Monitor roles while adding a new global role with Tester as the role name:\ndomainInfo: WLSRoles: Admin: UpdateMode: append Expression: \"?weblogic.entitlement.rules.IDCSAppRoleName(AppAdmin,@@PROP:AppName@@)\" Deployer: UpdateMode: replace Expression: \"?weblogic.entitlement.rules.AdministrativeGroup(@@PROP:Deployers@@)\" Monitor: UpdateMode: prepend Expression: \"?weblogic.entitlement.rules.AdministrativeGroup(AppMonitors)\" Tester: Expression: \"?weblogic.entitlement.rules.IDCSAppRoleName(AppTester,@@PROP:AppName@@)\" The Admin role will have the expression appended to the default expression, the Deployer role expression will replace the default, the Monitor role expression will be prepended to the default expression and Tester will be a new role with the specified expression.\nIn addition, the Expression value can use the variable placeholder syntax specified when running the Create Tool as shown in the previous example.\nWebLogic policies The model allows for the definition of additional authorization policies on WebLogic resources. Note that WDT does not currently support editing the default authorization policies shipped out of the box.\nTo define a new policy for a particular resource, you must make up a logical name for the policy and provide the ResourceID and Policy expression fields as shown in the example. Note that this name is important should you want to use multiple model files were one file needs to override the policy defined in an earlier model.\ndomainInfo: WLSPolicies: MyQueueSendPolicy: ResourceID: 'type=\u003cjms\u003e, application=MyJmsModule, destinationType=queue, resource=MyQueue, action=send' Policy: 'Grp(Administrators)|Grp(Operators)|Grp(Monitors)' To determine the correct ResourceID and Policy model values for a policy, try using the WebLogic Remote Console and its Security Data Tree to create the desired policy and then use the Advanced tab to view the Resource Id and Policy field values. The value of these fields in the WebLogic Remote Console can be copied directly into the ResourceID and Policy attributes in the model. Don’t forget that the values of these fields may need to be enclosed in quotes in the YAML model.\nKnown limitations The processing of users, groups, and roles will only take place when using the Create Domain Tool . WebLogic global roles are only supported with WebLogic Server version 12.2.1 or greater. WebLogic global roles are only updated for the WebLogic security XACML role mapping provider (for example, XACMLRoleMapper). Currently, WDT does not support modifying the default WebLogic authorization policies.",

The Validate Model Tool provides both validation and help for model authors as a standalone tool. In addition, the tool is integrated with the createDomain and deployApps tools to catch validation errors early, before any actions are performed on the domain.\nTo use the Validate Model Tool, simply run the validateModel shell script with the correct arguments. To see the list of valid arguments for any tool in the WebLogic Deploy Tooling installation, simply run the shell script with the -help option (or with no arguments) to see the shell script usage information.\nFor example, starting with the following model shown below, where the AdminServer attribute Machine is misspelled as Machines:\ntopology: Name: DemoDomain AdminServerName: AdminServer Cluster: mycluster: Server: AdminServer: ListenAddress: 192.168.1.50 ListenPort: 7001 Machines: machine1 SSL: Enabled: true ListenPort: 7002 ServerStart: ClassPath: c:\\foo\\bar m1: ListenAddress: 192.168.1.50 ListenPort: 8001 Cluster: mycluster Machine: machine1 ServerStart: ClassPath: c:\\foo\\bar m2: ListenAddress: 192.168.1.51 ListenPort: 8001 Cluster: mycluster Machine: machine2 ServerStart: ClassPath: c:\\foo\\bar Machine: machine1: NodeManager: ListenAddress: 192.168.1.50 ListenPort: 5556 machine2: NodeManager: ListenAddress: 192.168.1.51 ListenPort: 5556 To validate the standalone model file, run the tool as follows:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\validateModel.cmd -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -model_file InvalidDemoDomain.yaml The output of the tool will look something like this:\n----------------------------------------------- Validation Area: topology Section ----------------------------------------------- Errors: 1 Message: Machines is not one of the folder, folder instance or attribute names allowed in model location topology:/Server/AdminServer Use the Model Help Tool to determine the valid list of attributes and folders at this model location.\nIf the model contains variable definitions and the variable file or files is specified, the Validate Model Tool will validate that all variable references in the model are defined in the variable files. For example, invoking the tool as shown here:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\validateModel.cmd -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -model_file InvalidDemoDomain.yaml -variable_file InvalidDemoDomain.properties Results in output similar to that shown below, if the db.password variable is not defined in the variable file.\n----------------------------------------------- Validation Area: Variable Substitutions ----------------------------------------------- Errors: 2 Message: Model location resource:/JDBCSystemResource/Generic1/JdbcResource/JDBCDriverParams/PasswordEncrypted references variable db.password that is not defined in D:/demo/InvalidDemoDomain.properties Message: Model location resource:/JDBCSystemResource/Generic2/JdbcResource/JDBCDriverParams/PasswordEncrypted references variable db.password that is not defined in D:/demo/InvalidDemoDomain.properties If the model references binaries that should be present in the archive, the Validate Model Tool will validate that all binary references in the model that point to archive file locations are present in the archive file.

Each issue may contain a workaround or an associated issue number.\nWebLogic Kubernetes Operator Model-in-Image domains fail when using WebLogic Deploy Tooling 4.0.0 (and newer) ISSUE: Deploy a WebLogic Kubernetes Operator domain with Model-in-Image (MII) produces introspector failures.\nACTION: WDT 4.0 made significant changes to archive file path handling that required changes in WebLogic Kubernetes Operator, which became available starting in WebLogic Kubernetes Operator 4.2.0. Upgrade to WebLogic Kubernetes Operator 4.2.0+ to resolve the issue.\nDiscover Domain Tool SEVERE messages ISSUE: The discoverDomain STDOUT contains many SEVERE messages about cd() and ls() when it is run against a 12.2.1.0 domain. The Discover Domain Tool navigates through the domain MBeans using WLST to determine which MBeans are present in a domain. When it tests an MBean that is not present, an error message is logged by WLST. There is no 12.2.1.0 PSU available to address this WLST problem. It is resolved in 12.2.1.1.\nACTION: Ignore the following messages logged during discovery of a 12.2.1.0 domain.\n\u003cJan 14, 2019 1:14:21 PM\u003e \u003cSEVERE\u003e \u003cCommandExceptionHandler\u003e \u003chandleException\u003e \u003c\u003e \u003cError: cd() failed.\u003e \u003cJan 14, 2019 1:14:21 PM\u003e \u003cSEVERE\u003e \u003cCommandExceptionHandler\u003e \u003chandleException\u003e \u003c\u003e \u003cError: ls() failed.\u003e Create Domain Tool with NMProperties KeyStores attribute ISSUE: The Create Domain Tool does not properly set the model’s topology:/NMProperties/KeyStores properly so the domain is created without a KeyStores entry in nodemanager.properties.\nACTION: This is due to WLST Bug 37587121. Contact Oracle Support to get the appropriate patch to apply to your environment.\nCreate Domain Tool with 11g JRF domains ISSUE: The Create Domain Tool cannot initialize RCU for 11g JRF domains. The tool will issue error messages in the log and terminate the create process.\nACTION: Run the WLS rcu command before executing createDomain for JRF domains\nCredential in security configuration ISSUE: For WLS versions prior to 14.1.1, there is a problem setting the CredentialEncrypted attribute in the topology/SecurityConfiguration folder. The value is not encrypted properly in the configuration and the domain will fail to start with the error:\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: In production mode, it's not allowed to set a clear text value to the property: CredentialEncrypted of SecurityConfigurationMBean ACTION: Contact Oracle Support to obtain the patch for bug number 30874677 for your WebLogic Server version before running the tool.\nProblems setting RotateLogOnStartup attribute ISSUE: For existing WLS versions, there is a problem setting the RotateLogOnStartup attribute in various log file folders. The value is not persisted correctly, and the assignment will not be present when the domain is started.\nACTION: Contact Oracle Support to obtain the patch for bug number 29547985 for your WebLogic Server version before running the tool.\nDiscover Domain tool does not discover users or groups ISSUE: Discovering a domain does not attempt to discover users and groups defined in any configured Authentication Provider type.\nACTION: This should only be an issue for the domains using the DefaultAuthenticator, which uses the Embedded LDAP server that runs inside WebLogic Server as its user and group store. To discover the users and groups in the DefaultAuthenticator, use the -discover_security_provider_data switch with an argument that includes the DefaultAuthenticator (e.g., ALL or a comma-separated list of provider types like DefaultAuthenticator,DefaultCredentialMapper).\nJRF Domain configuration files containing clear text password ISSUE: After a JRF domain is created, the jps-config.xml and jps-config-jse.xml files contain clear text password for the key store.\nACTION: You will need to create a key store using Oracle Wallet and change the key store provider priority in the JVM. See Oracle Support Doc ID 2215283.1 for details. If you are creating a JRF domain using Oracle Autonomous Transaction Database, you can use the SSO key stores instead of JKS key stores, the generated jps-config.xml and jps-config-jse.xml files will then use the SSO key stores without any clear text password.\ndomainInfo: RCUDbInfo: databaseType : ATP rcu_prefix : FMW rcu_schema_password : '...' rcu_admin_password: '...' rcu_db_user : admin tns.alias : myatp_tp javax.net.ssl.keyStoreType: SSO javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType: SSO SSH usage ISSUE: WDT Create Domain does not appear to support SSH.\nACTION: WDT Create Domain does not support SSH cause domain creation needs to run on the machine where the domain will exist to ensure that paths in the generated domain files point to the actual Java and Oracle Homes. To support Create Domain via SSH, WDT would need to install itself on the remote machine and then execute its commands there. The workaround is for the user to temporarily install WDT, create the domain, and uninstall WDT.\nISSUE: WDT does not correctly handle the @@JAVA_HOME@@, @@PWD@@, and @@TMP path tokens.\nACTION: Do not use these path tokens in an SSH context because WDT does not currently provide a way for the user to supply “remote” values for these paths.\nProduction Redeployment of Versioned Applications ISSUE: WDT Update Domain does not properly deploy a new version of an application to support non-disruptive updates.\nACTION: While we fully intend to resolve this issue in an upcoming release, the workaround for now is to use the weblogic.Deployer tool to redeploy the application pointing at the new source files, as described in the WebLogic Server documentation .\nOnline Update Domain running on JDK 8 ISSUE: WDT Update Domain may fail if trying to update the values of RemoteAnonymousRmiiiopEnabled and RemoteAnonymousRmit3Enabled in the same Update Domain call.\n####\u003cJan 6, 2025 12:38:06 PM\u003e \u003cSEVERE\u003e \u003cupdate\u003e \u003cmain\u003e \u003cWLSDPLY-09015\u003e \u003cupdateDomain deployment failed: activate() failed: weblogic.rjvm.PeerGoneException: ; nested exception is: java.io.EOFException\u003e Issue Log for updateDomain version 4.3.0 running WebLogic version 12.2.1.4.0.240704 in online mode against server using WebLogic version 12.2.1.4.0.240704: WARNING Messages: 1.

    "content": "Starting with WDT 1.8.0, you can configure and update Oracle HTTP Server (OHS) using the Create Domain, Update Domain, and Deploy Applications Tools, in offline mode only. To discover the OHS configuration, use the Discover Domain Tool, in offline mode only. NOTE: The Deploy Applications Tool is deprecated in WDT 4.0.0.\nPrerequisites In order to configure and use OHS, it must be installed in the Oracle Home directory used to create the domain. You can download OHS here .\nThe OHS template must be present in the WDT domain type definition file used to create or update the domain. For more information on creating a custom definition, see Domain type definitions .\nYou create a copy of an existing domain type definition file, add the template to that file, and then reference that file on the WDT command line. For example, if you want to create a domain with Oracle HTTP Server based on a Restricted JRF domain, then you would first create a copy of the file WLSDEPLOY_HOME/lib/typedefs/RestrictedJRF.json in the same directory, such as WLSDEPLOY_HOME/lib/typedefs/HttpServer.json. In this example, you would change the existing extensionTemplates section to include the additional OHS template. The original value is:\n\"extensionTemplates\": [ \"Oracle Restricted JRF\", \"Oracle Enterprise Manager-Restricted JRF\" ], The revised value would be:\n\"extensionTemplates\": [ \"Oracle Restricted JRF\", \"Oracle Enterprise Manager-Restricted JRF\", \"Oracle HTTP Server (Restricted JRF)\" ], The file name of this new domain type (without the .json extension) is used with the -domain_type argument on the WDT command line. For example, the command line to create a domain using the HttpServer.json file from the previous steps would look like:\n$ WLSDEPLOY_HOME/bin/createDomain -oracle_home /etc/oracle ... -domain_type HttpServer Configuring the model Configuring OHS typically involves adding two top-level folders to the resources section of the model, SystemComponent and OHS. Here is an example:\nresources: SystemComponent: my-ohs: ComponentType: OHS Machine: my-machine OHS: my-ohs: AdminHost: 127.0.0.1 AdminPort: 9324 ListenAddress: 127.0.0.1 ListenPort: 7323 SSLListenPort: 4323 ServerName: http://localhost:7323 Each name under the OHS folder must match a name under the SystemComponent folder in the model, or the name of a SystemComponent element that has been previously created. In this example, the name my-ohs is in both places.\nThe ComponentType field of the SystemComponent element must be set to OHS in order to allow configuration of the corresponding OHS folders.\nYou can use the Model Help Tool to determine the complete list of folders and attributes that can be used in these sections of the model. For example, this command will list the attributes in the OHS folder:\n$ ${WDT_HOME}/bin/modelHelp.sh -oracle_home /tmp/oracle resources:/OHS",

    "content": "You can use the Extract Domain Resource Tool to create resource files for use with the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator. This allows the Kubernetes resource definitions to be generated from a model file. This is especially useful when making configuration changes to the domain that also need to be reflected in the resource file. For example, adding a cluster to the domain only requires that it be added to the topology section of the WDT model, then a new resource definition file can be generated that contains information pertaining to the new cluster to apply to Kubernetes.\nBy default, the resource file generated is pretty minimalistic and will always require editing. For example, the Extract Domain Resource Tool run against a simple model with only an Administration Server will generate something the looks similar the one shown here. Note that the .spec.domainHome attribute value was populated using the -domain_home command-line argument.\napiVersion: weblogic.oracle/v9 kind: Domain metadata: name: mydomain namespace: mydomain labels: weblogic.domainUID: mydomain spec: domainHome: /u01/domains/mydomain domainHomeSourceType: FromModel image: '{{{imageName}}}' # Add any credential secrets that are required to pull the image imagePullSecrets: [] webLogicCredentialsSecret: name: mydomain-weblogic-credentials serverPod: env: - name: JAVA_OPTIONS value: -Dweblogic.StdoutDebugEnabled=false - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: '-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Xms64m -Xmx256m ' configuration: introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds: 900 model: domainType: WLS modelHome: '{{{modelHome}}}' runtimeEncryptionSecret: mydomain-runtime-encryption-secret To help make this tool more useful (and more automated), the model includes an optional, top-level kubernetes section that feeds into the generated domain resource. Looking at the previous example output, you see that the .spec.image and .spec.configuration.model.modelHome attributes are replaced with model values.\nMore information about the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator can be found here .\nHere is an example command line for the Extract Domain Resource Tool:\n$ weblogic-deploy/bin/extractDomainResource.sh -model_file /tmp/mymodel.yaml -variable_file /tmp/my.properties -output_dir /tmp/resource -target wko -oracle_home /tmp/oracle -domain_home /u01/mydomain For the simplest case, the Extract Domain Resource Tool will create resource files based on the templates corresponding to the target argument, using information from the command line and the domain sections of the model. Information about target types and templates can be found Target environments page.\nThe value of the optional -domain_home argument will be applied to the corresponding field in the template output, if specified. As an alternative, the domain home value can be specified in the related section of the WDT model.\nDomain name and UID fields in the template will use the domain name in the topology section of the model, or the default base_domain. The cluster entries will be pulled from the topology section of the model; their replica counts will have been derived from the number of servers for each cluster.\nThe user is expected to fill in the image and secrets information identified by --FIX ME-- in the resource output.\nFor more advanced configurations, including pre-populating the --FIX ME-- values, the user can populate the related section of the WDT model, and those values will appear in the resulting custom resource definition (CRD) resource files. In this example the kubernetes section of the model overrides and adds some values to the CRD generated for WebLogic Kubernetes Operator.\nkubernetes: metadata: name: myName namespace: myNamespace spec: image: 'my.repo/my-image:2.0' imagePullSecrets: - name: WEBLOGIC_IMAGE_PULL_SECRET_NAME webLogicCredentialsSecret: name: '@@PROP:mySecret@@' configuration: model: domainType: 'WLS' secrets: - secret1 - secret2 serverPod: env: - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: '-XX:+UseContainerSupport -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom' - name: JAVA_OPTIONS value: '-Dmydir=/home/me' This example uses @@PROP:mySecret@@ to pull the value for webLogicCredentialsSecret from the variables file specified on the command line. This can be done with any of the values in the CRD sections of the model. More details about using model variables can be found here .\nUsing the wko target with this example, the resulting domain resource file would contain:\napiVersion: weblogic.oracle/v8 kind: Domain metadata: name: myName namespace: myNamespace spec: image: 'my.repo/my-image:2.0' imagePullSecrets: - name: WEBLOGIC_IMAGE_PULL_SECRET_NAME webLogicCredentialsSecret: name: WEBLOGIC_CREDENTIALS_SECRET_NAME serverPod: env: - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: '-XX:+UseContainerSupport -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom' - name: JAVA_OPTIONS value: '-Dmydir=/home/me' domainHome: /u01/mine/domain configuration: model: domainType: WLS secrets: - secret1 - secret2 clusters: - clusterName: mycluster replicas: 2 - clusterName: mycluster3 replicas: 4 If clusters are specified in the kubernetes/spec section of the model, those clusters will be combined with any clusters from the topology section of the model.\nIf the WDT model has a value of Never for spec/imagePullPolicy, the imagePullSecrets default value will not be added.\nA full list of sections and variables supported by the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator is available here . The Extract Domain Resource Tool supports a subset of these sections, including metadata, serverPod, and spec.\nThe Model Help Tool can be used to determine the folders and attributes that can be used in the CRD sections of the model. For example, this command will list the folders and attributes in the spec folder in the kubernetes section:\n\u003cwls-deploy-home\u003e/bin/modelHelp.sh -oracle_home /tmp/oracle kubernetes:/spec The content for the CRD sections is not generated when a model is discovered by the Discover Domain Tool.\nParameter table for extractDomainResource Parameter Definition Default -archive_file The path to the archive file. This can also be specified as a comma-separated list of archive files. The overlapping contents in each archive take precedence over previous archives in the list. -domain_home The domain home directory to be used in output files. This will override any value in the model. -model_file The location of the model file. This can also be specified as a comma-separated list of model locations, where each successive model layers on top of the previous ones. -oracle_home Home directory of the Oracle WebLogic installation.

Dynamic clusters were added in WebLogic Server version 12.1.2. In WebLogic Server version 12.2.1.1, the ability to target a single dynamic server group to a dynamic cluster was added. In WebLogic Server Version 12.2.1.4, you now have the ability to target multiple dynamic server groups to a dynamic cluster.\nTo enable targeting of dynamic server groups to dynamic clusters, add the dynamicClusterServerGroupsToTarget entry with any dynamic server groups you wish to be targeted to the dynamic clusters in your model or domain. This list must only contain one dynamic server group if you are running a version of WebLogic Server earlier than 12.2.1.4.\n{ \"definitions\": { \"dynamicClusterServerGroupsToTarget\" : [ \"WSMPM-DYN-CLUSTER\", \"WSM-CACHE-DYN-CLUSTER\" ] } } If you wish to specify which dynamic server group to target to a dynamic server, add DynamicClusterServerGroupTargetingLimits to the domainInfo of your model.

    "content": "Variable injectors are used to tokenize a model by substituting variable keys in place of attribute values, and creating a separate property file containing the variable values. This facilitates using the same domain model to create new domains in different environments. WebLogic Deploy Tooling includes several built-in injector directive files that can be used as-is or with modifications, and allows for creation of custom injector files.\nVariable injectors are used by the Discover Domain Tool , the Prepare Model Tool , and the standalone Variable Injector Tool to tokenize the models they produce.\nNote Variable injection on an attribute is only performed once. After being tokenized, an attribute is not re-tokenized by any subsequent injector directives.\nDefault configuration The default injector configuration is used by the standalone Variable Injector Tool, and by the Discover Domain Tool when it is run without the -target option. To enable variable injection for these tools, create a variable injector configuration by placing a JSON file named model_variable_injector.json into the \u003cWLSDEPLOY\u003e/lib directory.\nAnother option is to configure variable injection in a Custom configuration directory. Create the model_variable_injector.json file in the $WDT_CUSTOM_CONFIG directory.\nThe variable injector configuration file contains a list of injector names that map to the names of the injector files to be applied to the model.\nHere is an example of a model_variable_injector.json file that will apply topology and custom injectors to the model.\n{ \"injectors\": [ \"topology\", \"custom\" ] } Each injector name in the list refers to an injector directive file , and they are applied to the attributes in the model in the specified order.\nA sample of a model_variable_injector.json file is included in the WLSDEPLOY/samples directory.\nTargeted configuration Targeted injector configuration is used by the Prepare Model Tool, and by the Discover Domain Tool when it is run with the -target option. In this case, the list of injector names to be applied is specified in the variable_injectors field of the $WLSDEPLOY_HOME/lib/targets/\u003ctarget-name\u003e/target.json configuration file. For example, the $WLSDEPLOY_HOME/lib/targets/wko/target.json file contains this value:\n{ ... \"variable_injectors\" : [\"port\", \"host\", \"url\"], ... } Each injector name in the list refers to an injector directive file , and they are applied to the attributes in the model in the specified order.\nFor more information on creating and extending target configurations, see Target environments .\nInjector directive files Injector directive files contain a list of qualified attribute paths and associated directives. When a matching attribute is found in the model, the associated directive is applied to that attribute, then a property token with a unique variable name is injected into the model and replaces the attribute value. The variable name and model attribute value are placed into the external variable properties file.\nInjector directive files are placed in the $WLSDEPLOY_HOME/lib/injectors directory. User-defined files can be placed there or in a Custom configuration directory. To use the custom configuration directory, place these files in $WDT_CUSTOM_CONFIG/lib/injectors.\nWebLogic Deploy Tool includes these pre-configured injector directive files:\nhost.json - All MBean host attribute values in the model are injected with a variable. port.json - All MBean port attribute values in the model are injected with a variable. target.json - All MBean target attribute values in the model are injected with a variable. topology.json - Common environmental MBean attributes found in the topology section of the model are injected with a variable. This includes server, machine and Node Manager ports, listen addresses, and cluster messaging modes, addresses and ports. url.json - All MBean URL attribute values in the model are injected with a variable. The following is a model snippet that shows injected variables after applying the port injector directive file.\ntopology: Name: soa_domain AdminServerName: AdminServer Cluster: soa_cluster: osb_cluster: Server: AdminServer: ListenAddress: myadmin.example.com ListenPort: @@PROP:Server.AdminServer.ListenPort@@ Machine: machine1 SSL: Enabled: true ListenPort: @@PROP:Server.SSL.AdminServer.ListenPort@@ soa_server1: ListenAddress: managed1.example.com ListenPort: @@PROP:Server.soa_server1.ListenPort@@ Cluster: soa_cluster Machine: machine2 SSL: Enabled: true ListenPort: @@PROP:Server.SSL.soa_server1.ListenPort@@ soa_server2: ListenAddress: managed2.example.com ListenPort: @@PROP:Server.soa_server2.ListenPort@@ Cluster: soa_cluster Machine: machine3 SSL: Enabled: true ListenPort: @@PROP:Server.SSL.soa_server2.ListenPort@@ And the resulting variable property file:\nServer.AdminServer.ListenPort=7001 Server.AdminServer.SSL.ListenPort=7002 Server.soa_server1.ListenPort=8001 Server.soa_server1.SSL.ListenPort=8002 Server.soa_server2.ListenPort=8001 Server.soa_server2.SSL.ListenPort=8002 Custom variable injector To use custom injector directives, create an injector directive file with a meaningful name, and place it in the $WLSDEPLOY_HOME/lib/injectors directory, or $WDT_CUSTOM_CONFIG/lib/injectors if using a custom configuration directory. Add the file prefix to the list in the model_variable_injector.json file, or in the target.json file if targeted configuration is used. For example, create the file custom.json, and add a custom entry to the list.\nAn injector directive contains a key that identifies an attribute to be tokenized, and an optional set of directive properties. The key is a period-separated MBean hierarchy and attribute name as they are defined in the model. Always exclude the name of the model section from the injector key.\nFor example, an injector directive for the Server SSL Listen Port is as follows. This directive contains no additional properties.\n{ \"Server.SSL.ListenPort\": {} } NOTE: The hierarchy of MBeans in the model for the ListenPort attribute. Note that the MBean name of AdminServer is NOT included in the directive:\ntopology: Server: AdminServer: ListenAddress: myadmin.example.com ListenPort: 7001 Machine: machine1 SSL: Enabled: true ListenPort: 7002 A sample of a custom injector directive file is included in the $WLSDEPLOY_HOME/samples/injectors directory.\nInjector directive properties Include the following properties to refine the directive as specified.\nforce:\u003cattribute\u003e If the MBean hierarchy exists in the model, but the attribute does not, then the attribute will be added and persisted to the resulting model. The value stored in the model is the WebLogic default value.\nvariable_value: Replace the model value with the specified value in the variable properties. This may be used in conjunction with the force directive, replacing the default value with the indicated value.\nregexp: A list of regexp patterns that will be applied to either the string values or map values of an attribute in the model. If the pattern matches, then the matching part of the string or dictionary will be injected with a property token and a unique variable name.\npattern: The regular expression pattern to apply to the string value or map values of an attribute.\nsuffix: The suffix name to append to each resulting variable name in order to create a unique variable name.\nThe regexp list is useful when only a segment of a string value or map needs to be tokenized (giving you a clean list of property values in the variable properties file). You can inject more than one token into a string or map with multiple patterns. However, when you have more than one pattern, you must provide a suffix for each. This allows the tool to generate a unique variable name for each token in the string or map.\nThe following is an example of how to effectively use the regexp directive list to search for a segment in a string value. In this example, we want to search for the host and port in each Oracle JDBC URL that uses the special Oracle URL notation, and create an entry for the host and port in the variable properties file.\nIn the model, we expect to find a URL like the following:\nJDBCSystemResource: Database1: JdbcResource: JDBCDriverParams: URL: 'jdbc:oracle:thin:@(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS_LIST=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=slc05til.us.oracle.com)(PORT=1521)))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=orcl.us.oracle.com)))' We create a directive in our custom injector JSON file:\n\"JDBCSystemResource.JdbcResource.JDBCDriverParams.URL\": { \"regexp\": [ { \"pattern\": \"(?\u003c=PORT=)[\\\\w.-]+(?=\\\\))\", \"suffix\": \"Port\" }, { \"pattern\": \"(?\u003c=HOST=)[\\\\w.-]+(?=\\\\))\", \"suffix\": \"Host\" } ] }, When the tool is run, the pattern is applied to the URL string and tokens injected into the string:\nURL: 'jdbc:oracle:thin:@(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS_LIST=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=@@PROP:JDBCSystemResource.Database1.JdbcResource.JDBCDriverParams.URL--Host@@:)(PORT=@@PROP:JDBCSystemResource.Database1.JdbcResource.JDBCDriverParams.URL--Port@@)))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=orcl.us.oracle.com)))' And the variables put in the properties file:\nJDBCSystemResource.Database1.JdbcResource.JDBCDriverParams.URL--Host=slc05til.us.oracle.com JDBCSystemResource.Database1.JdbcResource.JDBCDriverParams.URL--Port=1521 Selecting specific MBean names for variable injection This final custom directive allows you to explicitly define which named entries for an MBean in the model you want to inject properties. For instance, you might want to tokenize an attribute just for a specific server. To define a list of one or more names for a specific MBean in the injector directive hierarchy, format the list as follows:\nMBean[comma separated list of names] To select only the Administration Server named AdminServer for a Server directive, use the format Server[AdminServer]. To select servers soa_server1 and soa_server2, format the key as Server[soa_server1,soa_server2].\nThe injector tool recognizes two KEYWORDS for a user list, MANAGED_SERVERS (all the Managed Servers in the model) and ADMIN_SERVER (the Administration Server in the model).\nA custom injector for the Administration Server SSL listen port is:\n{ \"Server[ADMIN_SERVER].SSL.ListenPort\": {} }",

    "content": "The Model Help Tool provides information about the folders and attributes that are valid for sections and folders of a domain model. This is useful when creating a new domain model, or expanding an existing model, including discovered models.\nHere is a simple example using the Model Help Tool:\n$ weblogic-deploy/bin/modelHelp.sh -oracle_home /tmp/oracle resources:/JDBCSystemResource This will result in the following output:\nAttributes and sub-folders for resources:/JDBCSystemResource resources: JDBCSystemResource: 'JDBC-1': CompatibilityName: # string * DeploymentOrder: # integer (default=100) * DeploymentPrincipalName: # string * DescriptorFileName: # string * ModuleType: # string * Notes: # string * SourcePath: # string * Target: # delimited_string * JdbcResource: # see /JDBCSystemResource/JdbcResource SubDeployment: 'SubDeployment-1': # see /JDBCSystemResource/SubDeployment This bean defines a system-level JDBC resource. It links a separate descriptor that specifies the definition. There are several important parts of this output.\nthe list of attributes for the folder the list of sub-folders the MBean description The following three sections discuss each of these in more detail.\nAttributes The sample output shows the eight attributes and two sub-folders available for the JDBCSystemResource folder in the resources section of the model. Each attribute includes a comment describing the type of the value to be added. An asterisk (*) next to an attribute indicates that the attribute has additional information available, possibly including a default value, valid range, and a description. To access this additional information, simply add the attribute name to the end of the path and re-invoke the Model Help Tool.\n$ weblogic-deploy/bin/modelHelp.sh -oracle_home /tmp/oracle /JDBCSystemResource/DeploymentOrder Attributes and sub-folders for resources:/JDBCSystemResource/DeploymentOrder resources: JDBCSystemResource: JDBC-1: DeploymentOrder: # integer Default=100 An integer value that indicates when this unit is deployed, relative to other deployable units on a server, during startup. Units with lower values are deployed before those with higher values. Sub-folders Folders that support multiple instances, such as SubDeployment in this example, are shown with a derived name, such as 'SubDeployment-1'. Each sub-folder includes a comment with a model path that can be used to display additional information about that sub-folder. For example, to determine the attributes and sub-folders for 'SubDeployment-1', the Model Help Tool could be re-invoked with the model path from the comment:\n$ weblogic-deploy/bin/modelHelp.sh -oracle_home /tmp/oracle /JDBCSystemResource/SubDeployment Attributes and sub-folders for resources:/JDBCSystemResource/SubDeployment resources: JDBCSystemResource: JDBC-1: SubDeployment: SubDeployment-1: CompatibilityName: # string * ModuleType: # string * Notes: # string * Target: # delimited_string * This bean represents an individually targetable entity within a deployment package, which is deployable on WLS. This includes : Modules in an EAR JMS resources within a app scoped JMS module in an EAR Note The /JDBCSystemResource/SubDeployment path omits the leading resources: element but still works because the Model Help Tool is able to determine which folder is being requested.\nMBean description The text at the bottom of the output comes directly from the WebLogic Server MBean description. This text varies by MBean and some MBeans have more useful information than others.\nPath patterns There are a number of ways to specify model location in the path argument. Here are some examples:\ntop List all the top-level model sections, such as topology, resources, and such.\n$ weblogic-deploy/bin/modelHelp.sh -oracle_home /tmp/oracle top Attributes and sub-folders for top:/ domainInfo: # see domainInfo: topology: # see topology: resources: # see resources: appDeployments: # see appDeployments: kubernetes: # see kubernetes: Section names List the attributes and folders within a section, such as topology, resources, and such.\n$ weblogic-deploy/bin/modelHelp.sh -oracle_home /tmp/oracle appDeployments Attributes and sub-folders for appDeployments:/ appDeployments: Application: App-1: # see /Application Library: Lib-1: # see /Library Folders List all the attributes and folders within a folder. As previously discussed, the path to the folder can include or exclude the top-level section name. If the section is not provided for a folder, then it will be derived and included in the output text. For example, resources:/JDBCSystemResource/JdbcResource and /JDBCSystemResource/JdbcResource are equivalent and will produce the same output.\n$ weblogic-deploy/bin/modelHelp.sh -oracle_home /tmp/oracle /JDBCSystemResource/JdbcResource Attributes and sub-folders for resources:/JDBCSystemResource/JdbcResource resources: JDBCSystemResource: JDBC-1: JdbcResource: Version: # string * JDBCConnectionPoolParams: # see /JDBCSystemResource/JdbcResource/JDBCConnectionPoolParams JDBCDataSourceParams: # see /JDBCSystemResource/JdbcResource/JDBCDataSourceParams JDBCDriverParams: # see /JDBCSystemResource/JdbcResource/JDBCDriverParams JDBCOracleParams: # see /JDBCSystemResource/JdbcResource/JDBCOracleParams JDBCXAParams: # see /JDBCSystemResource/JdbcResource/JDBCXAParams The top of the JDBC data source bean tree. JDBC data sources all have a JDBCDataSourceBean as their root bean (a bean with no parent). The schema namespace that corresponds to this bean is \"http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/jdbc-data-source\" Attribute help To show help for a particular attribute in a folder, simply add it to the model path. Note that the folder listing will include an asterisk at the end of an attribute line that has additional help information.\n$ weblogic-deploy/bin/modelHelp.sh -oracle_home /tmp/oracle topology:/Server/Log/StdoutSeverity Attributes and sub-folders for topology:/Server/Log/StdoutSeverity topology: Server: 'Server-1': Log: StdoutSeverity: # string Default=Notice Legal values: 'Trace' 'Debug' 'Info' 'Warning' 'Error' 'Notice' 'Critical' 'Alert' 'Emergency' 'Off' The minimum severity of log messages going to the standard out. Messages with a lower severity than the specified value will not be published to standard out. Output options There are several command-line options that you can use to control the output text for the model path. Use only one of these options at a time. If no output options are specified, then the attributes and immediate sub-folders for the specified path are listed.\nNote When the top sections are listed using the path top, any output options are ignored.\n-attributes_only This option will list only the attributes for the specified path.\n-folders_only This option will list only the immediate sub-folders for the specified path.\n-recursive This option will recursively list all the sub-folders within the specified path.

For example, to read password from a file, use the -ssh_pass_file parameter as shown.\n./weblogic-deplog/bin/verifySSH.sh -oracle_home $MW_HOME -ssh_host remote-machine.mycorp.io -ssh_user robertpatrick -ssh_pass_file /path/to/password/file.txt Testing file upload and download An SSH connection typically is sufficient to download a remote file or upload a local file to the remote system provided that the local and remote users have the necessary file system permissions. The Verify SSH tool allows you to optionally test uploading or downloading a file. For example, to test file upload, run verifySSH as shown.\n./weblogic-deplog/bin/verifySSH.sh -oracle_home $MW_HOME -ssh_host remote-machine.mycorp.io -local_test_file /path/to/local/file.txt -remote_output_dir /tmp To test file download, run verifySSH as shown.\n./weblogic-deplog/bin/verifySSH.sh -oracle_home $MW_HOME -ssh_host remote-machine.mycorp.io -remote_test_file /path/to/remote/file.txt -local_output_dir /tmp Environment variables The following environment variables may be set.\nJAVA_HOME The location of the JDK. This must be a valid Java 7 or later JDK. WLSDEPLOY_PROPERTIES System properties that will be passed to WLST. Warning When running the Verify SSH Tool (and any other tool that use WLST), the actual JDK used to run the tool will be the JDK used to install WebLogic Server in the Oracle Home and not the one defined by the JAVA_HOME environment variable. The best practice is to set JAVA_HOME to point to the same JDK installation that was used to install WebLogic Server.\nParameter table for verifySSH Parameter Definition Default -oracle_home Home directory of the Oracle WebLogic installation. Required if the ORACLE_HOME environment variable is not set. -ssh_host The DNS name or IP address of the remote host. -ssh_port The TCP port on the remote host where the sshd daemon is listening for connection requests. 22 -ssh_user The user name on the remote host to use for authentication purposes. Same as the local user running the tool. -ssh_pass_env The environment variable name to use to retrieve the remote user’s password when authenticating with user name and password. -ssh_pass_file The file name of a file that contains the password string for the remote user’s password when authenticating with user name and password. -ssh_pass_prompt A flag to force the tool to prompt the user to provide the remote user’s password through standard input when authenticating with user name and password. Do not prompt or read from standard input. -ssh_private_key The local file name of the user’s private key file to use when authenticating with a public/private key pair. $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa -ssh_private_key_pass_env The environment variable name to use to retrieve user’s private key passphrase when authenticating with a public/private key pair. -ssh_private_key_pass_file The file name of a file that contains the user’s private key passphrase string when authenticating with a public/private key pair. -ssh_private_key_pass_prompt A flag to force the tool to prompt the user to provide their private key passphrase through standard input when authenticating with a public/private key pair. Do not prompt or read from standard input. -remote_test_file The file name of a remote file to download to the local output directory during the verification process. -local_output_dir The local directory name to use to write the remote test file being downloaded during the verification process. -local_test_file The file name of a local file to upload to the remote output directory during the verification process. -remote_output_dir The remote directory name to use to write the local test file being uploaded during the verification process.",

    "content": "Changes in Release 4.2.0 Major New Features Other Changes Bugs Fixes Known Issues Major New Features None\nOther Changes #1682 - Added support for discovering built-in security provider data in online mode. This includes DefaultAuthenticator users and groups, XACMLAuthorizer policies, XACMLRoleMapper roles, and DefaultCredentialMapper user/password credential mappings. As with other discovery features, default values are filtered out and will not appear in the model. By default, discovering users and credential mappings require the use of WDT encryption so that no clear text passwords are stored in the model or variable files. #1682 - Normalized XACMLRoleMapper role handling by removing the previous discovery of XACMLRoleMapper roles (that was not working with newer versions of WebLogic anyway) and removing version limitations during provisioning. #1682 - Deprecated the -use_encryption command-line argument and replaced it with -passphrase_prompt to make the purpose of the argument clearer. #1682 - Relaxed the JDK 8 requirement to use WDT encryption. Later versions of JDK 7 have the necessary algorithm support so now WDT determines at startup whether the underlying JDK supports WDT encryption or not. #1682 - Used the values of the -admin_user and provided password to populate the domainInfo:/AdminUserName and domainInfo:/AdminPassword fields when discovering security provider data. #1688 - Enhanced variable tokenization support to include passwords in discovered security provider data. #1689 - Added the ability to discover the OPSS wallet when running in online mode. #1693 - Changed the wko, wko-dii (deprecated), and wko-pv target values to refer to the latest versions instead of WebLogic Kubernetes Operator 3 versions. Added wko3, wko3-dii, and wko3-pv to accommodate users that still require the ability to use these older versions. #1697 - Added support for the Prepare Model Tool to preserve any one-way hashed passwords in the model. #1700 - Added support for storing XACML policy and role definitions that could not be converted to their original policy and role expressions as XACML files in the archive file. Bug Fixes #1687 - Fixed a problem with the Discover Domain Tool not properly handling Data Source user names with spaces with older versions of WebLogic Server. #1690 - Fixed a problem with determining the default security realm name that caused it to always be myrealm. #1692 - Fixed a misleading error message when the model points to an application outside of the archive file that does not exist. #1695 - Fixed an issue where the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator domain.yaml was including a placeholder for the domainHome attribute in all cases so that the WebLogic Image Tool could populate it when creating the image. This was occurring even in use cases where the WebLogic Image Tool did not have this information. WDT no longer does this and will only include the domainHome in the case where the user has specified it on the command line, or in the kubernetes section of the model. #1698 - Fixed issues with the new messages related to the security provider data discovery features. #1701 - Moved the TestSummaryHandler logging class out of the installer since it is only meant for supporting unit tests. #1702 - Fixed a bug in deployment plan discovery for exploded applications. #1703 - Fixed a bug in discovery of domainBin scripts. #1705 - Added missing validation for the WLSUserPasswordCredentialMappings section. #1706 - Fixed a validation bug that was causing lax validation to fail when archive entries were missing. #1707 - Fixed a bug in the handling of the ActiveContextHandlerEntry attribute of an Auditor security provider.

    "description": "Changes in Release 4.2.0 Major New Features Other Changes Bugs Fixes Known Issues Major New Features None\nOther Changes #1682 - Added support for discovering built-in security provider data in online mode. This includes DefaultAuthenticator users and groups, XACMLAuthorizer policies, XACMLRoleMapper roles, and DefaultCredentialMapper user/password credential mappings. As with other discovery features, default values are filtered out and will not appear in the model. By default, discovering users and credential mappings require the use of WDT encryption so that no clear text passwords are stored in the model or variable files. #1682 - Normalized XACMLRoleMapper role handling by removing the previous discovery of XACMLRoleMapper roles (that was not working with newer versions of WebLogic anyway) and removing version limitations during provisioning. #1682 - Deprecated the -use_encryption command-line argument and replaced it with -passphrase_prompt to make the purpose of the argument clearer. #1682 - Relaxed the JDK 8 requirement to use WDT encryption. Later versions of JDK 7 have the necessary algorithm support so now WDT determines at startup whether the underlying JDK supports WDT encryption or not. #1682 - Used the values of the -admin_user and provided password to populate the domainInfo:/AdminUserName and domainInfo:/AdminPassword fields when discovering security provider data. #1688 - Enhanced variable tokenization support to include passwords in discovered security provider data. #1689 - Added the ability to discover the OPSS wallet when running in online mode. #1693 - Changed the wko, wko-dii (deprecated), and wko-pv target values to refer to the latest versions instead of WebLogic Kubernetes Operator 3 versions. Added wko3, wko3-dii, and wko3-pv to accommodate users that still require the ability to use these older versions. #1697 - Added support for the Prepare Model Tool to preserve any one-way hashed passwords in the model. #1700 - Added support for storing XACML policy and role definitions that could not be converted to their original policy and role expressions as XACML files in the archive file. Bug Fixes #1687 - Fixed a problem with the Discover Domain Tool not properly handling Data Source user names with spaces with older versions of WebLogic Server. #1690 - Fixed a problem with determining the default security realm name that caused it to always be myrealm. #1692 - Fixed a misleading error message when the model points to an application outside of the archive file that does not exist. #1695 - Fixed an issue where the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator domain.yaml was including a placeholder for the domainHome attribute in all cases so that the WebLogic Image Tool could populate it when creating the image. This was occurring even in use cases where the WebLogic Image Tool did not have this information. WDT no longer does this and will only include the domainHome in the case where the user has specified it on the command line, or in the kubernetes section of the model. #1698 - Fixed issues with the new messages related to the security provider data discovery features. #1701 - Moved the TestSummaryHandler logging class out of the installer since it is only meant for supporting unit tests. #1702 - Fixed a bug in deployment plan discovery for exploded applications. #1703 - Fixed a bug in discovery of domainBin scripts. #1705 - Added missing validation for the WLSUserPasswordCredentialMappings section. #1706 - Fixed a validation bug that was causing lax validation to fail when archive entries were missing. #1707 - Fixed a bug in the handling of the ActiveContextHandlerEntry attribute of an Auditor security provider.

    "content": "Changes in Release 3.0.0 Major New Features Other Changes Bugs Fixes Known Issues Major New Features #1355: Added -remote option to the deployApps tool that supports deploying applications and shared libraries from a remote machine. (Issue #1312) #1355: Added -remote option to the updateDomain tool that allows configuration changes not requiring archive file changes (except for applications and shared libraries) to be made from a remote machine. (Issue #1167) #1365: Added new verrazzano section of the model that can be used to augment/override the YAML files generated by the Verrazzano-related -target options. (WDT-688) #1367: New archiveHelper tool for helping to create and update the archive file from the command line. (WDT-711) Cleaned up the aliases to clean up online discovery and put tests in place to ensure that they align properly with the various WebLogic Server releases and PSUs. The resulting model from online discovery is now much closer to the one generated by offline discovery. Other Changes #1255: Renamed model attributes to align with the offline naming strategy:\nSystemComponent MWHome model attribute renamed to MwHome. WebserviceSecurity DefaultCredentialProviderSTSURI model attribute renamed to DefaultCredentialProviderStsuri. #1299: Renamed model attributes to align with the offline naming strategy:\nSecurityConfiguration IdentityAssertionCacheTTL model attribute renamed to IdentityAssertionCacheTtl. #1310: Resolved issue that was causing the PSU version of several 12.2.1.3 PSUs to be incorrect.\n#1314, #1342: Added knowledge to the aliases to understand how default values change when using production mode and secure production mode. (WDT-678)\n#1328: Changed tool exit code handling to exit with exit code 1 if warnings exist and exit code 2 if errors exist in the summary report. (WDT-692)\n#1331: Deprecated the old archive locations of the OPSS wallet and ATP wallet in the archive file. The old locations will be honored but will result in one or more deprecation messages. (WDT-687)\n#1334: Removed support for storing the model files in the archive. (WDT-643)\n#1341: Remove deprecated -domain_resource_file argument from the extractDomainResource tool. (WDT-706)\n#1348: Renamed the old ATP wallet to rcu wallet. (WDT-709)\n#1348: Added support for adding wallets either as a ZIP file or an exploded directory with one or more files. When the wallet is added as a ZIP file, the createDomain and updateDomain tools will expand the ZIP into the domain home, just as before.\n#1348: Added database wallet support for multiple wallets. Other database wallets can be added, as needed. (WDT-710)\n#1351: Removed support for the deprecated “named object list” format from the kubernetes section of the model. (WDT-688)\n#1366: Refactored ATP and SSL database support to be more unified in their modeling approach.\n#1369: Added a special log level for deprecation messages so that they can show up in the tools’ summary reports without causing a non-zero exit status. (WDT-721)\n#1375: Revamped application installation directory discovery to capture the entire application installation directory. (WDT-715)\n#1379: Added the ability for discovery to collect the JDBC wallet file(s) in the archive.\n#1380: Updated the approach for generating the Verrazzano custom resource related to the Ingress Trait routing rules to add a destination host/port and allow the user to add Paths via the new verrazzano section of the model. (WDT-696)\n#1383: Removed the DomainVersion domain-level attribute from discovered models and replaced it with a comment describing the WDT and WebLogic Server version numbers used to discover the model and which WLST mode was used for discovery. (WDT-698)\n#1386: Changed attribute not valid in the current WebLogic version warnings to log INFO level messages instead. (WDT-724)\n#1389: Added additional model and WebLogic Kubernetes Operator/Verrazzano target validation around dynamic clusters to catch modeling issues prior to domain creation. (WDT-726)\n#1391: Revamped tool summary report and remote report generated when using remote discovery. (WDT-637)\n#1395: Added unclustered servers to the WKTUI integration output of prepareModel (WDT-730)\nBug Fixes #1261, #1266: Corrected a discoverDomain error message when a keystore was missing. (WDT-685) #1324: Resolved an issue causing secure mode not to be discovered. (WDT-694) #1327: Resolved an issue where WLST errors in WLS 12.2.1.0.0 were showing up in the tools’ summary reports. (WDT-691) #1329: Changed the tools summary log handler to not accept any messages that did not originate in WDT proper. (WDT-701) #1330: Fixed a Windows issue with environment variable substitution where environment variable references in the model that were not all uppercase were not working properly. #1335: Removed unused and undocumented -prev_model_file argument from the deployApps and updateDomain tools. (WDT-707) #1344: Removed -archive_file argument from the extractDomainResource tool since the model can no longer be stored in the archive file. (WDT-708) #1367: Corrected the behavior of the archive class to rename directories when an existing directory of the same name already exists. This makes the behavior for files and directories consistent. (WDT-722) #1374: Corrected a problem discovering a domain using a Coherence cluster with a custom configuration file. #1376: Corrected an issue with compareModel pertaining to comparisons of the JVM arguments and whitespace (Issue #1370) #1382: Removed misleading log entries during startup that displayed the WebLogic Server version with no PSU information (WDT-727) #1392: Fixed an issue with online discovery of domains with dynamic clusters where the dynamic servers were erroneously being added as configured servers. #1393: Fixed an issue causing an empty SecureMode folder to show up in an online discovered model. (WDT-731) #1394: Fixed alias entries to prevent some INFO messages with errors related to alias entries during online discovery. Known Issues When running discoverDomain with the -remote flag, there are several MBeans that are not being properly handled that will result in INFO level messages that look similar to the example shown below. These errors seem to happen only when the MBean is non-existent so the resulting model should still be accurate.
