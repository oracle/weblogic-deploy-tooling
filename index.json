	"content": "The Create Domain Tool uses a model and WLST offline to create a domain. To use the tool, at a minimum, the model must specify the domain\u0026rsquo;s administrative password in the domainInfo section of the model, as shown below.\ndomainInfo: AdminPassword: welcome1 Using the model above, simply run the createDomain tool, specifying the type of domain to create and where to create it.\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\createDomain.cmd -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -domain_type WLS -domain_parent d:\\demo\\domains -model_file MinimalDemoDomain.yaml  Clearly, creating an empty domain with only the template-defined servers is not very interesting, but this example just reinforces how sparse the model can be. When running the Create Domain Tool, the model must be provided either inside the archive file or as a standalone file. If both the archive and model files are provided, the model file outside the archive will take precedence over any that might be inside the archive. If the archive file is not provided, the Create Domain Tool will create the topology section only (using the domainInfo section) of the model in the domain. This is because the resources and appDeployments sections of the model can reference files from the archive so to create the domain with the model-defined resources and applications, an archive file must be provided\u0026ndash;even if the model does not reference anything in the archive. At some point in the future, this restriction may be relaxed to require the archive only if it is actually needed.\nThe Create Domain Tool understands three domain types: WLS, RestrictedJRF, and JRF. When specifying the domain type, the Oracle Home must match the requirements for the domain type. Both RestrictedJRF and JRF require an Oracle Home with the FMW Infrastucture (also known as JRF) installed. When creating a JRF domain, the RCU database information must be provided as arguments to the createDomain script. Note that the tool will prompt for any passwords required. Optionally, they can be piped to standard input (for example, stdin) of the script, to make the script run without user input. For example, the command to create a JRF domain looks like the one below. Note that this requires the user to have run RCU prior to running the command.\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\createDomain.cmd -oracle_home c:\\jrf12213 -domain_type JRF -domain_parent d:\\demo\\domains -model_file DemoDomain.yaml -rcu_db mydb.example.com:1539/PDBORCL -rcu_prefix DEMO [-rcu_db_user SYS]  To have the Create Domain Tool run RCU, simply add the -run_rcu argument to the previous command line and the RCU schemas will be automatically created. Be aware that when the tool runs RCU, it will automatically drop any conflicting schemas that already exist with the same RCU prefix prior to creating the new schemas!\nIt is also possible to specify the connection information in the model instead of using the command-line arguments. This is especially easier for databases that require complex database connection string and extra parameters, such as RAC or Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing Cloud Service database. For information on how to use it, refer to Specifying RCU connection information in the model.\nTo create more complex domains, it may be necessary to create a custom domain type. This is useful for cases where the domain has custom templates, or templates for other Oracle products. For more information, refer to Domain type definitions.\nUsing an encrypted model If the model or variables file contains passwords encrypted with the WDT Encryption tool, decrypt the passwords during create with the -use_encryption flag on the command line to tell the Create Domain Tool that encryption is being used and to prompt for the encryption passphrase. As with the database passwords, the tool can also read the passphrase from standard input (for example, stdin) to allow the tool to run without any user input. You can bypass the stdin prompt with two other options. You can bypass the stdin prompt with two other options: store the passphrase in an environment variable, and use the environment variable name with the command-line option -passphrase_env or create a file with the single value of the passphrase. Provide the name of the file with the command-line option -passphrase_file. The passphrase will be read by the tool from the file.\nUsing multiple models The Create Domain Tool supports the use of multiple models, as described in Using multiple models.\nDevelopment domain and boot.properties When creating a development domain, WDT provides the convenience of making a boot.properties file for each of the servers in the domain. The boot.properties file will contain encrypted values of the Administration Server user name and password. When the Administration Server or Managed Server is started, WebLogic Server will bypass the prompt for credentials, and instead use the credentials from the boot.properties file.\nA domain is in production mode if the ServerStartMode option is set to prod or the domain ProductionModeEnabled is set to true. The default value for both of these attributes is development mode.\nThe boot.properties file is stored in the domain home on the machine where WDT runs. It is stored for each server as \u0026lt;domain_home\u0026gt;/servers/\u0026lt;server_name\u0026gt;/security/boot.properties.\nThe following is a model example with both attributes explicitly set to development mode.\ndomainInfo: AdminUserName: weblogic AdminPassword: welcome1 ServerStartMode: dev topology: Name: my-domain AdminServerName: admin-server ProductionModeEnabled: false Parameter table for createDomain    Parameter Definition Default     -archive_file The path to the archive file to use. If the -model_file argument is not specified, the model file in this archive will be used. This can also be specified as a comma-separated list of archive files. The overlapping contents in each archive take precedence over previous archives in the list.    -domain_home Required if -domain_parent is not used. The full directory and name where the domain should be created.    -domain_parent Required if -domain_home is not used. The parent directory where the domain should be created. The name is the domain name in the model.    -domain_type The type of domain (for example, WLS, JRF). WLS   -java_home The Java home to use for the new domain. If not specified, it defaults to the value of the JAVA_HOME environment variable.    -model_file The location of the model file. This can also be specified as a comma-separated list of model locations, where each successive model layers on top of the previous ones.    -oracle_home Home directory of the Oracle WebLogic installation. Required if the ORACLE_HOME environment variable is not set.    -opss_wallet The location of the Oracle wallet containing the domain\u0026rsquo;s encryption key required to reconnect to an existing set of RCU schemas.    -opss_wallet_passphrase_env An alternative to entering the OPSS wallet passphrase at a prompt. The value is an environment variable name that WDT will use to retrieve the passphrase.    -opss_wallet_passphrase_file An alternative to entering the OPSS wallet passphrase at a prompt. The value is the name of a file with a string value which WDT will read to retrieve the passphrase.    -passphrase_env An alternative to entering the encryption passphrase at a prompt. The value is an environment variable name that WDT will use to retrieve the passphrase.    -passphrase_file An alternative to entering the encryption passphrase at a prompt. The value is the name of a file with a string value which WDT will read to retrieve the passphrase.    -rcu_db (deprecated) The RCU database connect string.    -rcu_prefix (deprecated) The RCU prefix to use.    -rcu_db_user (deprecated) The RCU dbUser to use. sys   -run_rcu Run RCU to create the database schemas specified by the domain type using the specified RCU prefix. Running RCU will drop any existing schemas with the same RCU prefix if they exist prior to trying to create them.    -use_encryption One or more of the passwords in the model or variables file(s) are encrypted and must be decrypted. Java 8 or later required for this feature.    -variable_file The location of the property file containing the values for variables used in the model. This can also be specified as a comma-separated list of property files, where each successive set of properties layers on top of the previous ones.     "

	"content": "Administration Server configuration The Create Domain Tool lets you configure the Administration Server using a domain model. These examples show how some common configurations can be represented in the model.\nUsing the default Administration Server configuration When the Create Domain Tool is run, the templates associated with your domain type will automatically create an Administration Server named AdminServer, with default values for all the attributes. If you don\u0026rsquo;t need to change any of these attributes, such as ListenAddress or ListenPort, or any of the sub-folders, such as SSL or ServerStart, nothing needs to be added to the model.\nCustomizing the Administration Server configuration To customize the configuration of the default Administration Server, you will need to add a server with the default name AdminServer. Because you are not changing the name of the Administration Server, there is no need to specify the AdminServerName attribute under the topology section. This example shows some attributes and sub-folders:\ntopology: Server: AdminServer: ListenPort: 9071 RestartDelaySeconds: 10 ListenAddress: my-host-1 Log: FileCount: 9 LogFileSeverity: Info FileMinSize: 5000 SSL: HostnameVerificationIgnored: true JSSEEnabled: true ListenPort: 9072 Enabled: true The most common problem with this type of configuration is to misspell the name of the folder under Server, when it should be AdminServer. This will result in the creation of an Administration Server with the default name, and an additional Managed Server with the misspelled name.\nConfiguring the Administration Server with a different name If you want the Administration Server to have a name other than the default AdminServer, you will need to specify that name in the AdminServerName attribute, and use that name in the Server section. This example uses the name my-admin-server:\ntopology: AdminServerName: my-admin-server Server: \u0026#39;my-admin-server\u0026#39;: ListenPort: 9071 RestartDelaySeconds: 10 ListenAddress: my-host-1 Log: FileCount: 9 LogFileSeverity: Info FileMinSize: 5000 SSL: HostnameVerificationIgnored: true JSSEEnabled: true ListenPort: 9072 Enabled: true The most common problem with this type of configuration is to mismatch the AdminServerName attribute with the name in the Server folder. This will change the name of the default Administration Server to the value of AdminServerName, and the folder under Server to be created as an additional Managed Server.\nThe name of the Administration Server cannot be changed after domain creation, so any changes to the AdminServerName attribute will be ignored by the Update Domain Tool.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": "Contents  Overview Top-level sections Simple example Model names Model tokens Model semantics Declaring named MBeans to delete Using multiple models Upgrading from WDT 1.x to WDT 2.x YAML files  Overview The metadata model (or model, for short) is a version-independent description of a WebLogic Server domain configuration. The tools are designed to support a sparse model so that the model need only describe what is required for the specific operation without describing other artifacts. For example, to deploy an application that depends on a JDBC data source into an existing domain that may contain other applications or data sources, the model needs to describe only the application and the data source in question. If the data source was previously created, the deployApps tool will not try to recreate it but may update part of that data source\u0026rsquo;s configuration if the model description is different than the existing values. If the application was previously deployed, the deployApps tool will compare the binaries to determine if the application needs to be redeployed or not.\nThe model structure, and its folder and attribute names, are based on the WLST 12.2.1.3 offline structure and names with redundant folders removed to keep the model simple. For example, the WLST path to the URL for a JDBC data source is /JDBCSystemResource/\u0026lt;data-source-name\u0026gt;/JdbcResource/\u0026lt;data-source-name\u0026gt;/JDBCDriverParams/NO_NAME_0/URL. In the model, it is resources:/JDBCSystemResource/\u0026lt;data-source-name\u0026gt;/JdbcResource/JDBCDriverParams/URL (where resources is the top-level model section where all WebLogic Server resources/services are described).\nThe model is written in YAML (or optionally, JSON). The YAML parser, built into the underlying framework, is both strict with regard to the specification and supports only the subset of YAML needed to describe WebLogic Server artifacts. For example, YAML does not support tabs as indent characters so the parser will generate parse errors if the model file contains leading tabs used for indentation purposes. In general, names and values can be specified without quotes except when the content contains one of the restricted characters; in which case, the content must be enclosed in either single or double quotes. The restricted characters are:\n comma colon exclamation mark question mark hyphen ampersand percent sign \u0026ldquo;at\u0026rdquo; sign star pound sign (also known as hash) equal sign less than greater than square brackets curly braces back quote  All assignment statements must have one or more spaces between the colon and the value. All comments must have a space after the pound sign (also known as hash) to be considered a comment. YAML doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow comments in all locations. While the YAML parser used by the framework does not try to enforce these restrictions, it is likely that putting comments in some locations may cause parse errors since YAML is a difficult language to parse due to its complex indentation rules.\nTop-level model sections The tooling has five top-level model sections:\n domainInfo - The location where special information not represented in WLST is specified (for example, the libraries that go in $DOMAIN_HOME/lib). topology - The location where servers, clusters, machines, server templates, and other domain-level configuration is specified. resources - The location where resources and services are specified (for example, data sources, JMS, WLDF). appDeployments - The location where shared libraries and applications are specified. kubernetes - The location where the WLS Kubernetes Operator domain configuration is specified.  Simple example Here is a simple example of a model to deploy an application and its data source:\nresources: JDBCSystemResource: MyDataSource: Target: \u0026#39;@@PROP:myjcs.cluster1.name@@\u0026#39; JdbcResource: JDBCDataSourceParams: JNDIName: jdbc/generic1 JDBCDriverParams: DriverName: oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver URL: jdbc:oracle:thin:@//@@PROP:dbcs1.url@@ PasswordEncrypted: \u0026#39;@@PROP:dbcs1.password@@\u0026#39; Properties: user: Value: \u0026#39;@@PROP:dbcs1.user@@\u0026#39; oracle.net.CONNECT_TIMEOUT: Value: 5000 JDBCConnectionPoolParams: MaxCapacity: 50 appDeployments: Application: simpleear : SourcePath: wlsdeploy/applications/simpleear.ear Target: \u0026#39;@@PROP:myjcs.cluster1.name@@\u0026#39; ModuleType: ear Library: \u0026#39;jsf#2.0\u0026#39;: SourcePath: \u0026#39;@@WL_HOME@@/common/deployable-libraries/jsf-2.0.war\u0026#39; Target: \u0026#39;@@PROP:myjcs.cluster1.name@@\u0026#39; ModuleType: war The above example shows two important features of the framework. First, notice that the URL, PasswordEncrypted, user property Value and all Target fields contain values that have a @@PROP:\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;@@ pattern. This indicates a variable placeholder whose value is specified at runtime using a variables file. For more information about this and other token types, see Model tokens.\nSecond, notice that the jsf#2.0 shared library SourcePath attribute value starts with @@WL_HOME@@. This is a path token that can be used to specify that the location is relative to the location of the WebLogic Server home directory on the target environment. For more information and a list of available path tokens, see Model tokens.\nThe example above shows the attribute SourcePath of the simpleear application with a value of wlsdeploy/applications/simpleear.ear. The prefix wlsdeploy/ indicates that the resource is located in the archive file in the specified location, and will be deployed to that directory within the domain, in this case \u0026lt;domain-home\u0026gt;/wlsdeploy/applications/simpleear.ear. See the Archive file for more details about using the archive file.\nUsers can create further directory structures underneath the above locations to organize the files and directories as they see fit. Note that any binary that already exists on the target system need not be included in the archive provided that the model specified the correct location on the target system.\nOne final note is that the framework is written in such a way to allow the model to be extended for use by other tools. Adding other top-level sections to the model is supported and the existing tooling and framework will simply ignore them, if present. For example, it would be possible to add a soaComposites section to the model where SOA composite applications are described, and a location within the archive file where those binaries can be stored, so that a tool that understands SOA composites and how to deploy them could be run against the same model and archive files.\nModel names The WebLogic Deploy Tooling handles names of WebLogic Server configuration artifacts in a very prescribed way. To understand how names are handled, users first need a basic understanding of WLST offline naming. In WLST offline, there are two general categories of configuration artifacts:\n Artifacts that can hold zero or more references to another configuration artifact type. Artifacts that can hold zero or one reference to another configuration artifact.  For example, a domain can contain zero or more JDBCSystemResource or AppDeployment instances but can only contain a single SecurityConfiguration artifact. When working with configuration artifacts like JDBCSystemResource, the name is always modeled as a sub-element of the JDBCSystemResource element, as shown below.\nresources: JDBCSystemResource: MyDataSource: Target: mycluster ... YourDataSource: Target: yourcluster ... In the example above, the model has two instances of JDBCSystemResource: one named MyDataSource and one named YourDataSource. For anyone familiar with WLST, this should seem somewhat familiar because the WLST offline path to the MyDataSource configuration will always start with /JDBCSystemResource/MyDataSource. What might not seem familiar is that in this WLST folder, there is a Name attribute that is also set to MyDataSource. The WebLogic Deploy Tooling requires that modelers set the JDBCSystemRTesource name using the folder semantics as shown in the example. It is not possible to set the Name using the Name attribute inside the folder and any attempts to do so, will not work; in this case, the Name attribute is redundant because the name was already specified as the folder name.\nWhen working with artifacts like SecurityConfiguration or JMX, there is never more than one instance of these artifacts in a domain because they are just configuration containers and their names generally have no semantic meaning. As such, the WebLogic Deploy Tooling does not expose these names in the model, as shown below:\ntopology: SecurityConfiguration: NodeManagerUsername: weblogic NodeManagerPasswordEncrypted: welcome1 As the example above shows, the SecurityConfiguration element has no named sub-element, as there is with JDBCSystemResource, even though the WLST path to the SecurityConfiguration attributes is /SecurityConfiguration/\u0026lt;domain-name\u0026gt;. The WebLogic Deploy Tooling has built-in rules and a knowledge base that controls how these names are handled so that it can complete the configuration of these artifacts. As with the previous class of configuration artifact, the folder almost always contains a  Name attribute that, in WLST, could be used to change the name. As with the previous class of artifact, the WebLogic Deploy Tooling does not support the use of the Name attribute in these folders and any attempt to set the Name attribute will not be honored. In general, the only model location that uses the Name attribute is the top-level topology section, because this maps to where WLST stores the domain name.\nModel tokens The model allows the use of tokens that are substituted with text values as the model is processed. This section describes several types of tokens.\nVariable tokens are declared with the syntax @@PROP:\u0026lt;variable\u0026gt;@@. This type of token represents a value that is resolved at runtime using a variables file in a standard Java properties file format. Variables can be used for any value and for some names. For example, to automate standing up an environment with one or more applications in the Oracle Java Cloud Service, service provisioning does not allow the provisioning script to specify the server names. For example, if the application being deployed immediately following provisioning needs to tweak the Server Start arguments to specify a Java system property, the model can use a variable placeholder in place of the server name and populate the variable file with the provisioned server names dynamically between provisioning and application deployment.\nFile tokens are declared with the syntax @@FILE:\u0026lt;filename\u0026gt;@@. This type of token is similar to a variable token, but it references a single value that is read from the specified file. For example, the model may reference a password attribute as follows:\nPasswordEncrypted: \u0026#39;@@FILE:/home/me/dbcs1.txt@@\u0026#39; The file /home/me/dbcs1.txt would then contain this single line:\npassword#123 As the model is processed, the value for the PasswordEncrypted would resolve to password#123. It is also possible to combine file placeholders with other types of tokens, to allow for variations in the name and location of the file, such as:\nPasswordEncrypted: \u0026#39;@@FILE:/dir/@@PROP:name@@.txt@@\u0026#39; PasswordEncrypted: \u0026#39;@@FILE:@@ORACLE_HOME@@/dir/name.txt@@\u0026#39; Environment tokens are declared with the syntax @@ENV:\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;@@. This type of token is resolved by looking up the system environment variable \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;, and substituting that value for the token.\nSecret tokens are declared with the syntax @@SECRET:\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;key\u0026gt;@@. This type of token is resolved by determining the location of a Kubernetes secret file, and reading the first line from that file. That line is substituted for the token.\nThere are two methods for deriving the location of the Kubernetes secret file. The first method involves using one or more configured root directories, and looking for the secret file in the path \u0026lt;root-directory\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;key\u0026gt;.\nThe root directories are configured as a comma-separated list of directories, using the environment variable WDT_MODEL_SECRETS_DIRS. For example, if WDT_MODEL_SECRETS_DIRS is set to /etc/my-secrets,/etc/your-secrets, then the token @@SECRET:secrets:the-secret@@ will search the following locations:\n/etc/my-secrets/secrets/the-secret /etc/your-secrets/secrets/the-secret If either of these files is found, the secret is read from that file and substituted in the model.\nThe second method for locating the Kubernetes secret file is to use the environment variable WDT_MODEL_SECRETS_NAME_DIR_PAIRS to map \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; values to specific directory locations. For example, if WDT_MODEL_SECRETS_NAME_DIR_PAIRS is set to my-root=/etc/my-secrets,your-root=/etc/your-secrets, then the token @@SECRET:your-root:the-secret@@ will look for the secrets file at:\n/etc/your-secrets/the-secret If the \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; value has a corresponding mapped directory in WDT_MODEL_SECRETS_NAME_DIR_PAIRS, then that directory will take precedence over any roots specified in WDT_MODEL_SECRETS_DIRS.\nIt is important that the secrets directories contain only secrets files, because those files are examined to create a list of available name/key pairs.\n Path tokens are tokens that reference known values, and can be used to make the model more portable. For example, a model may reference a WebLogic library source path as:\nSourcePath: \u0026#39;@@WL_HOME@@/common/deployable-libraries/jsf-2.0.war\u0026#39; Using the path token @@WL_HOME@@ allows the model to be used across multiple environments, even if the WebLogic installation directory is different. Path tokens can be used at any location in the model that specifies a file or directory location. The supported tokens are:\n @@ORACLE_HOME@@ - The location where WebLogic Server and any other FMW products are installed (in older versions, this was known as the MW_HOME). @@WL_HOME@@ - The location within the Oracle Home where WebLogic Server is installed (for example, the $ORACLE_HOME/wlserver directory in 12.1.2+). @@DOMAIN_HOME@@ - The location of the domain home directory on which the tool is working. @@PWD@@ - The current working directory from which the tool was invoked. @@TMP@@ - The location of the temporary directory, as controlled by the java.io.tmpdir system property.  Model semantics When modeling configuration attributes that can have multiple values, the WebLogic Deploy Tooling tries to make this as painless as possible. For example, the Target attribute on resources can have zero or more clusters and/or servers specified. When specifying the value of such list attributes, the user has freedom to specify them as a list or as a comma-delimited string (comma is the only recognized delimiter for lists). For attributes where the values can legally contain commas, the items must be specified as a list. Examples of each are shown below.\nresources: JDBCSystemResource: MyStringDataSource: Target: AdminServer,mycluster JdbcResource: JDBCDataSourceParams: JNDIName: jdbc/generic1, jdbc/special1 ... MyListDataSource: Target: [ AdminServer, mycluster ] JdbcResource: JDBCDataSourceParams: JNDIName: [ jdbc/generic2, jdbc/special2 ] ... WLDFSystemResource: MyWldfModule: Target: mycluster WLDFResource: Harvester: HarvestedType: weblogic.management.runtime.ServerRuntimeMBean: Enabled: true HarvestedInstance: [ \u0026#39;com.bea:Name=AdminServer,Type=ServerRuntime\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;com.bea:Name=m1,Type=ServerRuntime\u0026#39; ] ... In the example above, the Target attribute is specified three different ways, as a comma-separated string, as a list, and as a single string in the case of where there is only a single target. The JNDIName attribute is specified as a comma-separated string and as a list (a single string also works). On the other hand, the HarvestedInstances attribute had to be specified as a list because each element contains commas.\nOne of the primary goals of the WebLogic Deploy Tooling is to support a sparse model where the user can specify just the configuration needed for a particular situation. What this implies varies somewhat between the tools but, in general, this implies that the tools are using an additive model. That is, the tools add to what is already there in the existing domain or domain templates (when creating a new domain) rather than making the domain conform exactly to the specified model. Where it makes sense, a similar, additive approach is taken when setting the value of multi-valued attributes. For example, if the model specified the cluster mycluster as the target for an artifact, the tooling will add mycluster to any existing list of targets for the artifact. While the development team has tried to mark attributes that do not make sense to merge accordingly in our knowledge base, this behavior can be disabled on an attribute-by-attribute basis, by adding an additional annotation in the knowledge base data files. The development team is already thinking about how to handle situations that require a non-additive, converge-to-the-model approach, and how that might be supported, but this still remains a wish list item. Users with these requirements should raise an issue for this support.\nDeclaring named MBeans to delete With WebLogic Deploy Tooling, you can specify named items in the model to be deleted using the Create Domain, Update Domain, and Deploy Applications Tools. Named items are those that have multiple instances that are distinguished by user-provided names, such as managed servers, data sources, and security realms. Items to be deleted are prepended with an exclamation point (!) in the model.\nIn this example, the managed server obsoleteServer will be deleted, and newServer will be created:\nNote that the exclamation point, along with the name, should be inside quotation marks:\nServer: \u0026#39;!obsoleteServer\u0026#39;: newServer: ListenAddress: 127.0.0.1 ListenPort: 9005 This feature can also remove items that were created by WebLogic Server templates. For example, the base template creates a default security realm called myrealm. If a user chooses to declare a custom realm, myrealm is no longer needed. In this example, myrealm will be deleted, and the custom realm newrealm will be created, and declared as the default realm:\nSecurityConfiguration: DefaultRealm: newrealm Realm: \u0026#39;!myrealm\u0026#39;: newrealm: AuthenticationProvider: ... This feature does not apply to named security providers within a realm. These items follow a special set of rules that are required to maintain their ordering. See Modeling security providers for detailed information.\nThis feature can be used to undeploy applications or remove libraries.\nDeclaring list items to delete In addition to deleting named mbeans, you can remove items from a list. Most practically, this would be within a Target list.\nJMSSystemResource: BPMJMSModule: Target: soa_cluster,\u0026#39;!AdminServer\u0026#39; In this example, the BPMJMSModule has the AdminServer target removed from the target list.\nUsing multiple models The Create Domain, Update Domain, Deploy Applications, and Validate Model Tools allow the specification of multiple models on the command line. For example:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\createDomain.cmd -model_file modelOne,modelTwo,modelThree ...  In this case, the models are merged into a single model before being applied. Each successive model is added to the previous model. In cases where entities exist in both models, the attributes are combined and attribute values from successive models prevail. The resulting model is then verified before being applied. For example, if Model 1 looks like:\ntopology: Server: m1: ListenPort: 7000 Notes: Server 1 m2: ListenPort: 9000 and Model 2 looks like:\ntopology: Server: m1: ListenAddress: myhostname ListenPort: 8000 m3: ListenPort: 10000 The attributes for server m1 are merged, server m2 is left unchanged, and server m3 is added. The resulting model would be:\ntopology: Server: m1: ListenAddress: myhostname ListenPort: 8000 Notes: \u0026#34;Server 1\u0026#34; m2: ListenPort: 9000 m3: ListenPort: 10000 If variable properties are used in element names, such as @@PROP:my-server@@, the names in both models will be resolved and matching elements will be merged.\nMultiple models and delete notation A named element using delete notation will completely delete an element with a matching name and no delete notation in a previous model. For example, if Model 1 looks like:\ntopology: Server: m1: ListenPort: 7000 Notes: Server 1 m2: ListenPort: 9000 and Model 2 looks like:\ntopology: Server: \u0026#39;!m2\u0026#39;: The resulting model would be:\ntopology: Server: m1: ListenPort: 7000 Notes: Server 1 Similarly, an element without delete notation will completely replace an element with a matching name that has delete notation in a previous model. For example, if Model 1 looks like:\ntopology: Server: \u0026#39;!m1\u0026#39;: and Model 2 looks like:\ntopology: Server: m1: ListenPort: 7000 Notes: Server 1 The resulting model would be:\ntopology: Server: m1: ListenPort: 7000 Notes: Server 1 Upgrading from WDT 1.x to WDT 2.x YAML files Beginning in 2.0, WebLogic Deploy Tooling now incorporates the SnakeYAML parser for reading and writing model files. This may require some changes to existing models in order to be parsed correctly.\n Model elements that use delete notation need to be escaped in single or double quotation marks.  topology: Server: \u0026#39;!ms1\u0026#39;: ms2:  Model elements under the same parent should be indented to the exact same level. The previous YAML parser did not enforce this restriction, but it is standard for YAML. In this example, each cluster is indented four spaces.  topology: Cluster: cluster1: ClientCertProxyEnabled: True cluster2: WeblogicPluginEnabled: true   Object lists in the kubernetes section of the model now should be specified in a hyphenated list format, similar to how they appear in the domain resource file produced for WebLogic Kubernetes Operator.\nclusters: - clusterName: \u0026#39;cluster1\u0026#39; allowReplicasBelowMinDynClusterSize: true - clusterName: \u0026#39;cluster2\u0026#39; allowReplicasBelowMinDynClusterSize: true  The \u0026ldquo;named object list\u0026rdquo; format is deprecated now, and will cause warning messages to be displayed.  clusters: \u0026#39;cluster1\u0026#39;: allowReplicasBelowMinDynClusterSize: true \u0026#39;cluster2\u0026#39;: allowReplicasBelowMinDynClusterSize: true   The deprecated argument -model_sample has been removed from the Model Help Tool. The Model Help Tool has used model sample format, by default, since release 1.9.2.\n  "

	"content": "WebLogic Deploy Tooling supports the use of model filters to manipulate the domain model. The Create Domain, Update Domain, and Deploy Applications Tools apply filters to the model after it is read, before it is validated and applied to the domain. The Discover Domain Tool applies filters to the model after it has been discovered, before the model is validated and written.\nModel filters are written in Jython, and must be compatible with the version used in the corresponding version of WLST. A filter must implement the method filter_model(model), which accepts as a single argument the domain model as a Jython dictionary. This method can make any adjustments to the domain model that are required. Filters can be stored in any directory, as long as they can be accessed by WebLogic Deploy Tooling.\nThe following filter example (fix-password.py) sets the password for two attributes in the SecurityConfiguration WLST folder.\ndef filter_model(model): if model and \u0026#39;topology\u0026#39; in model: if \u0026#39;SecurityConfiguration\u0026#39; in model[\u0026#39;topology\u0026#39;]: model[\u0026#39;topology\u0026#39;][\u0026#39;SecurityConfiguration\u0026#39;][\u0026#39;CredentialEncrypted\u0026#39;] = \u0026#39;welcome1\u0026#39; model[\u0026#39;topology\u0026#39;][\u0026#39;SecurityConfiguration\u0026#39;][\u0026#39;NodeManagerPasswordEncrypted\u0026#39;] = \u0026#39;welcome1\u0026#39; print \u0026#39;Replaced SecurityConfiguration password\u0026#39; else: print \u0026#39;SecurityConfiguration not in the model\u0026#39; Model filters are configured by creating a model_filters.json file in the WLSDEPLOY_HOME/lib directory. This file has separate sections for filters to be applied for specific tools.\nAnother option is to configure model filters in a Custom configuration directory. Create the model_filters.json file in the $WDT_CUSTOM_CONFIG directory.\nThis example configures two filters for the Create Domain Tool: fix-password.py and no-mail.py, and one filter for the Discover Domain tool.\n{ \u0026#34;create\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;fixPassword\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/home/user/fix-password.py\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;noMail\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/home/user/no-mail.py\u0026#34; } ], \u0026#34;deploy\u0026#34;: [ ], \u0026#34;discover\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;noMail\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/home/user/no-mail.py\u0026#34; } ], \u0026#34;update\u0026#34;: [ ] } Internal Filters Internal filters are provided by WebLogic Deploy Tooling to perform modifications to the domain model. They are referenced by ID in the target configuration file. This example shows the use of the internal filter wko_filter and a user-defined filter fix-password for use with the Create Domain Tool.\n{ \u0026#34;create\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;fixPassword\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/home/user/fix-password.py\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;wko_filter\u0026#34; } ] } Internal filters cannot be copied or modified like other types of filters.\nInternal filter wko_filter This filter prepares the domain model for use with WebLogic Kubernetes Operator. It performs the following modifications:\n Removes any attributes that can only be deployed in online mode Sets the CalculatedListenPorts attribute to false for dynamic clusters Warns if servers in a static cluster have different listen ports  "

	"content": "The archive file is used to deploy binaries and other file resources to the target domain. The archive is a ZIP file with a specific directory structure. Any file resources referenced in the model that are not already on the target system must be stored in the correct location in the archive, and the model must reflect the path into the archive. The model itself can also be stored inside the archive, if desired.\nNote that file resources that already exist on the target system need not be included in the archive, provided that the model specifies the correct location on the target system.\nContents  Example Archive structure Using multiple archive files  Example This example shows an application with a SourcePath value referencing an EAR file resource contained in the archive.\nappDeployments: Application: simpleear : SourcePath: wlsdeploy/applications/simpleear.ear Target: my-cluster ModuleType: ear The example above shows the attribute SourcePath of the simpleear application with a value of wlsdeploy/applications/simpleear.ear. The prefix wlsdeploy/ indicates that the resource is located in the archive file in the specified location, and will be deployed to that directory in the domain, in this case \u0026lt;domain-home\u0026gt;/wlsdeploy/applications/simpleear.ear.\nArchive structure These are the paths within the archive that are used for different types of resources. Users can create further directory structures underneath these locations to organize the files and directories as they see fit.\natpwallet The directory where a wallet can be stored for use with Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing Cloud Database. The file resource name is not specified in the model, and is assumed to be a single ZIP file in the archive at this location.\nmodel The directory where the model is optionally located. Only one model file, either in YAML or JSON, is allowed, and it must have the appropriate YAML or JSON file extension.\nopsswallet The directory where a wallet can be stored for use with Oracle Platform Security Services. The file resource name is not specified in the model, and is assumed to be a single ZIP file in the archive at this location.\nwlsdeploy/applications The root directory under which applications are stored. Applications can be stored in the archive as EAR or WAR files, or expanded under this folder.\nExpanded application directories are supported after WebLogic Deploy Tooling release 1.6.2.\n A sample expanded WAR application might have these entries:\nwlsdeploy/applications/myApp/index.jsp wlsdeploy/applications/myApp/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF wlsdeploy/applications/myApp/WEB-INF/classes/MyClass.class wlsdeploy/applications/myApp/WEB-INF/web.xml wlsdeploy/applications/myApp/WEB-INF/weblogic.xml wlsdeploy/classpathLibraries The root directory under which JARs/directories used for server classpaths are stored. Every file resource under this directory is extracted, even those not referenced in the model.\nwlsdeploy/coherence The root directory under which empty directories must exist for Coherence persistent stores.\nwlsdeploy/custom This is the root directory where your custom files can be stored and extracted from the archive. These files are not collected by the Discover Domain Tool. Every file resource under this directory is extracted during createDomain and updateDomain.\nwlsdeploy/domainBin The root directory under which $DOMAIN_HOME/bin scripts are stored. Only scripts referenced in the domainInfo/domainBin section of the model are extracted.\nwlsdeploy/domainLibraries The root directory under which $DOMAIN_HOME/lib libraries are stored. Only libraries referenced in the domainInfo/domainLibraries section of the model are extracted.\nwlsdeploy/nodeManager The root directory under which Node Manager file resources, such as keystore files, are stored.\nwlsdeploy/scripts The root directory under which scripts are stored. These can include JDBC create scripts, and WLDF action scripts.\nwlsdeploy/servers The root directory under which server files, such as keystore files, are stored. These are organized by server name, such as wlsdeploy/server/my-server/mykey.jks.\nwlsdeploy/sharedLibraries The root directory under which shared libraries are stored. These are stored as JAR files within the archive.\nwlsdeploy/stores The root directory under which empty directories must exist for FileStore elements in the model.\nUsing multiple archive files The Create Domain, Update Domain, Deploy Applications, and Validate Model Tools allow the specification of multiple archive files on the command line. For example:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\createDomain.cmd -archive_file one.zip,two.zip,three.zip ...  File resources can be present in any of these archives. Resources in each archive will supersede resources found in previous archives.\nWhen the model references a resource that is present in multiple archives, the latest in the list takes precedence. For example, if the model references wlsdeploy/applications/myapp.ear, and that resource is present in archives one.zip and two.zip, the resource in two.zip will be used.\nA similar rule applies for resources that have an assumed location, but are not specifically called out in the model. For example, if archive two.zip has a wallet in location atpwallet/wallet2.zip, and three.zip has a wallet in location atpwallet/wallet3.zip, the wallet atpwallet/wallet3.zip will be used.\nResources that are extracted without being referenced directly are extracted from the archives in the order specified in the archive_file argument. For example, if one.zip and two.zip have resources under wlsdeploy/classpathLibraries, the resources in one.zip will be extracted to \u0026lt;domain-home\u0026gt;/wlsdeploy/classpathLibraries, then the resources of two.zip will be extracted to the same location, overwriting any overlapping files.\n"

}, \u0026#34;definitions\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;SOA_12213\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;baseTemplate\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Basic WebLogic Server Domain\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;extensionTemplates\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;Oracle SOA Suite\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;serverGroupsToTarget\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;JRF-MAN-SVR\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;WSMPM-MAN-SVR\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;SOA-MGD-SVRS\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;rcuSchemas\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;STB\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;WLS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;MDS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;IAU\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;IAU_VIEWER\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;IAU_APPEND\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;OPSS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;UCSUMS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;SOAINFRA\u0026#34; ] } } } After the new domain typedef file exists, simply specify the new domain type name to the createDomain script, being sure to reference an Oracle Home with the required components installed. For pre-12.2.1 versions, the -wlst_path argument must be used to point to the product home where the appropriate WLST shell script exists; for example, for SOA 12.1.3, add -wlst_path \u0026lt;ORACLE_HOME\u0026gt;/soa so that the tool uses the WLST shell script with the proper environment for SOA domains. In 12.2.1 and later, this is no longer necessary because the WLST shell script in the standard \u0026lt;ORACLE_HOME\u0026gt;oracle_common/common/bin directory will automatically load all components in the Oracle Home. Using the new domain type, simply run the following command to run RCU and create the SOA domain with all of its resources and applications deployed.\n weblogic-deploy\\bin\\createDomain.cmd -oracle_home d:\\SOA12213 -domain_type SOA -domain_parent d:\\demo\\domains -model_file DemoDomain.yaml -archive_file DemoDomain.zip -variable_file DemoDomain.properties -run_rcu -rcu_db mydb.example.com:1539/PDBORCL -rcu_prefix DEMO [-rcu_db_user SYS]  Custom extension templates The customExtensionTemplates attribute can be used to specify custom extension templates to be applied to the domain. These should be specified as absolute file paths, and can use tokens.\n{ \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MyCustom\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;My custom type domain definitions\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;versions\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;12.2.1.3\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;My_12213\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;definitions\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;My_12213\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;baseTemplate\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Basic WebLogic Server Domain\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;extensionTemplates\u0026#34;: [ ], \u0026#34;customExtensionTemplates\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;/user/me/templates/my-template.jar\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;@@ORACLE_HOME@@/user_templates/other-template.jar\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;serverGroupsToTarget\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;MY-MAN-SVR\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;rcuSchemas\u0026#34;: [ ] } } } If there are any server groups in the custom template that should be targeted to managed servers, they should be specified in the serverGroupsToTarget attribute, similar to MY_MAN_SVR in the example above.\nUsing compact profile The topologyProfile field can be used to create a domain using a specific profile for each of the templates. This partial example will apply the compact profile for each of the specified templates.\n{ \u0026#34;copyright\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Copyright (c) 2022, Oracle Corporation and/or its affiliates.

The default behavior for WebLogic Deploy Tooling is to invoke applyJRF only when the extensionTemplates list includes JRF templates.\nA custom type definition file can require applyJRF to be invoked after the templates are added. This is done by setting the targeting attribute to APPLY_JRF, as in this example:\n{ \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MyCustom\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;My custom type domain definitions\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;versions\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;10.3.6\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;My_11G\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;definitions\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;My_11G\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;baseTemplate\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;@@WL_HOME@@/common/templates/wls/wls.jar\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;extensionTemplates\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;/user/me/templates/my-template.jar\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;targeting\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;APPLY_JRF\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;serverGroupsToTarget\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;MY-MAN-SVR\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;rcuSchemas\u0026#34;: [ ] } } } The targeting attribute is not valid for WebLogic Server versions 12.2.1 and later.\nUsing the typedef file to exclude template installed resources from the model and archive The Discover Domain Tool attempts to provide a sparse model by employing strategies such as not including attributes that are default values. It is important to not install template resources through the model. First, the templates will install the same resources in the target domain. Second, if you install resources from a on-premises domain into a target domain that is a later WebLogic version, it could cause conflicts. The Discover Domain Tool uses the discover-filters section of the typedef file to filter out discovered objects and exclude them from the model and archive files.\nThe list contains an entry for each type of resource to exclude, along with a list of names or regular expressions that are used to match the name of the specified type to exclude.\nThe following example is the discover-filters list in the JRF.json typedef file. Note that the key is the model name starting from the top-level folder (and excluding the grouping construct names topology, resources, and appDeployments).\n\u0026#34;discover-filters\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;/Application\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;^coherence-transaction-rar$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^DMS Application.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^em$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^FMW Welcome Page Application.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^opss-rest$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^state-management-provider-memory-rar.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^wsil-wls.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^wsm-pm$\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;/CoherenceClusterSystemResource\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;^defaultCoherenceCluster$\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;/JDBCSystemResource\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;.*LocalSvcTblDataSource$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;.*mds-owsm$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;.*opss-audit-DBDS$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;.*opss-audit-viewDS$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;.*opss-data-source$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;.*opss-ds$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;.*WLSSchemaDataSource$\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;/FileStore\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;^JRFWSAsyncFileStore$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^mds-owsm$\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;/JMSSystemResource\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;^JRFWSAsyncJmsModule$\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;/JMSServer\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;^JRFWSAsyncJmsServer$\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;/Library\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;^adf\\\\.oracle\\\\.businesseditor.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^adf\\\\.oracle\\\\.domain.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^adf\\\\.oracle\\\\.domain\\\\.webapp.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^em_common.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^em_core_ppc_pojo_jar$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^em_error.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^em_sdkcore_ppc_public_pojo_jar$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^emagentsdk_jar.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^emagentsdkimpl_jar.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^emagentsdkimplpriv_jar.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^emas$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^emcore$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^emcore_jar$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^emcoreclient_jar$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^emcorecommon_jar$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^emcoreconsole_jar$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^emcoreintsdk_jar.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^emcorepbs_jar$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^emcoresdk_jar.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^emcoresdkimpl_jar.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^jsf.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^jstl.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^log4j_jar.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^odl\\\\.clickhistory.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^odl\\\\.clickhistory\\\\.webapp.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^ohw-rcf.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^ohw-uix.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^oracle\\\\.adf\\\\.dconfigbeans.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^oracle\\\\.adf\\\\.desktopintegration.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^oracle\\\\.adf\\\\.desktopintegration\\\\.model.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^oracle\\\\.adf\\\\.management.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^oracle\\\\.bi\\\\.adf\\\\.model\\\\.slib.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^oracle\\\\.bi\\\\.adf\\\\.view\\\\.slib.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^oracle\\\\.bi\\\\.adf\\\\.webcenter\\\\.slib.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^oracle\\\\.bi\\\\.composer.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^oracle\\\\.bi\\\\.jbips.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^oracle\\\\.dconfig-infra.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^oracle\\\\.jrf\\\\.system\\\\.filter$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^oracle\\\\.jsp\\\\.next.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^oracle\\\\.pwdgen.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^oracle\\\\.sdp\\\\.client.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^oracle\\\\.sdp\\\\.messaging.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^oracle\\\\.webcenter\\\\.composer.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^oracle\\\\.webcenter\\\\.skin.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^oracle\\\\.wsm\\\\.console.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^oracle\\\\.wsm\\\\.idmrest.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^oracle\\\\.wsm\\\\.seedpolicies.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^orai18n-adf.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^owasp\\\\.esapi.*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^UIX.*\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;/ShutdownClass\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;^DMSShutdown$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^JOC-Shutdown$\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;/StartupClass\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;^JMX Framework Startup Class$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^JOC-Startup$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^JPS Startup Class$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^JPS Startup Post-Activation Class$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^WSM Startup Class$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^Web Services Startup Class$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^JRF Startup Class$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^ODL-Startup$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^DMS-Startup$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;^AWT Application Context Startup Class$\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;/WLDFSystemResource\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;^Module-FMWDFW$\u0026#34; ] } This mechanism also supports other named top-level fields; for example, /JDBCStore and /MailSession.

	"content": "This document describes how specific features of WebLogic Deploy Tooling are implemented in the source code.\nCreator and Deployer class hierarchies The creation of individual folders and attributes within the topology section of the domain model is accomplished using subclasses of the Jython class Creator, in the module wlsdeploy.tool.create.creator.py. The Creator class provides base methods to recurse through nested folders in the domain model, create or update those folders, and set or update their attributes. Each subclass can override these methods to account for variations in behavior for different functional areas.\nFor example, the SecurityProviderCreator subclass overrides the method _create_named_subtype_mbeans with special processing to remove all existing security providers, and re-create them from the data in the model.\nThe update of folders and attributes in the resources section of the domain model follows a similar pattern, but the base class for these modules is Deployer in the module wlsdeploy.tool.deploy.deployer.py.\nThe class TopologyUpdater is a special subclass of Deployer that is used to update elements in the topology section after their initial creation.\n"

	"content": "Contents  Overview Specifying a target environment Pre-configured target environments Using secret credentials in the model Merging content from the WDT model Target configuration files  Overview The Discover Domain and Prepare Model Tools allow you to customize the model and other files produced to be compatible with a specific target environment. Options for a target environment may include:\n Using model tokens for some attributes in the model. For more details, see Model tokens. Using Kubernetes secrets for credentials in the model. For more details, see Using secret credentials in the model. Applying filters to the model. For more details, see Model filters. Creating additional configuration files for the target system.  Specifying a target environment Each tool specifies a target environment using the command-line argument -target \u0026lt;target-name\u0026gt;, where \u0026lt;target-name\u0026gt; refers to a pre-configured target environment, or a user-defined environment. In addition, the -output_dir \u0026lt;output-directory\u0026gt; argument specifies where the files for the target environment will be stored.\nThis command line shows how you can use these arguments with the Discover Domain Tool:\n$ $WLSDEPLOY_HOME/bin/discoverDomain.sh ... -target k8s -output_dir /etc/files This example would apply the k8s target type to the discovery result, and place those files in /etc/files.\nIf a variable file is specified on the tool\u0026rsquo;s command line using the -variable_file argument, any injected variables will be added to that file. If no variable file is specified, injected variables will be written to the file \u0026lt;output-directory\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;target_name\u0026gt;_variable.properties.\nPre-configured target environments These target environment configurations are included in the WebLogic Deploy Tooling installation.\nThe WebLogic Kubernetes Operator targets You can use these targets to customize the model and create a domain resource file for use with WebLogic Kubernetes Operator. There are three targets for specific domain home source types:\n wko and wko4 for Model in Image deployments wko-dii and wko4-dii for Domain in Image deployments wko-pvand wko4-pv for Domain in PV deployments  Targets beginning with wko are for use with WebLogic Kubernetes Operator versions 3.*, and those beginning with wko4 are for use with versions 4.0.0 and later.\nEach of these targets provides this additional processing:\n The wko_filter filter will be applied to remove model elements that are not compatible with the Kubernetes environment, and adjust some attribute values Variables will be injected into the model for port, host, and URL attributes lax validation will be applied for the resulting model An additional Kubernetes resource file, wko-domain.yaml, will be produced, with cluster and naming information derived from the model  In addition, the wko target will replace credentials in the model with references to Kubernetes secrets, and produce a script to create those secrets. The wko-dii and wko-pv targets will replace credentials in the model with variable references.\nThe Verrazzano targets You can use these targets to customize the model and create a Kubernetes resource file for use with Verrazzano. There are three targets for specific domain home source types:\n vz for Model in Image deployments vz-dii for Domain in Image deployments vz-pv for Domain in PV deployments  Each of these targets provides this additional processing:\n The vz_filter filter will be applied to remove model elements that are not compatible with the Kubernetes environment, and adjust some attribute values Variables will be injected into the model for port, host, and URL attributes lax validation will be applied for the resulting model An additional Kubernetes resource file, vz-application.yaml, will be produced, with cluster and data source information derived from the model  In addition, the vz target will replace credentials in the model with references to Kubernetes secrets, and produce a script to create those secrets. The vz-dii and vz-pv targets will replace credentials in the model with variable references.\nGeneric Kubernetes target You can apply this target environment by providing the command-line argument -target k8s. It will provide this additional processing:\n The k8s_filter filter will be applied to remove model elements that are not compatible with the Kubernetes environment, and adjust some attribute values Variables will be injected into the model for port, host, and URL attributes lax validation will be applied for the resulting model Credentials in the model will be replaced with references to Kubernetes secrets, and a script to create those secrets will be produced  Using secret credentials in the model If a target environment is configured to use Kubernetes secrets for credential attribute values, each of those values is replaced with a token using the format @@SECRET:@@ENV:DOMAIN_UID@@\u0026lt;secret-suffix\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;key\u0026gt;. For example:\nPasswordEncrypted: \u0026#39;@@SECRET:@@ENV:DOMAIN_UID@@-jdbc-generic1:password@@\u0026#39; When a domain is created or updated using a model with these tokens, the environment variable DOMAIN_UID should be set to the domain\u0026rsquo;s UID, and secrets with corresponding names should have been created. For more details about using secret tokens, see Model Tokens.\nFor some target environments, the WebLogic admin credentials use a variation of this token format. For example:\ndomainInfo: AdminUserName: \u0026#39;@@SECRET:__weblogic-credentials__:username@@\u0026#39; AdminPassword: \u0026#39;@@SECRET:__weblogic-credentials__:password@@\u0026#39; In this case, the token __weblogic-credentials__ allows these attributes to reference secrets in a specific location. The WDT_MODEL_SECRETS_NAME_DIR_PAIRS environment variable should be set to associate __weblogic-credentials__ to this location. For example:\nWDT_MODEL_SECRETS_NAME_DIR_PAIRS=__weblogic-credentials__=/etc/my-secrets For more details about using the WDT_MODEL_SECRETS_NAME_DIR_PAIRS environment variable, see Model Tokens .\nIn WebLogic Kubernetes Operator Model in Image environments, the environment variable DOMAIN_UID is automatically set from the value in the domain resource file. The variable WDT_MODEL_SECRETS_NAME_DIR_PAIRS is automatically set to the directory containing WebLogic admin credentials.\nThe create secrets script For target environments that use Kubernetes secret tokens, a shell script is created to generate the required secrets. The script is named create_k8s_secrets.sh, and is created in the target output directory. The script has commands to create each secret, for example:\n# Update \u0026lt;user\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; for weblogic-credentials create_paired_k8s_secret weblogic-credentials \u0026lt;user\u0026gt; \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; The script should be updated with correct \u0026lt;user\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; values as required. It may be necessary to change the NAMESPACE and DOMAIN_UID variables at the top of the script if they are different in the target environment.\nThe script performs a check to determine if any generated secret names are more than 63 characters in length, because that will prevent them from being mounted correctly in the Kubernetes environment. If any secret names exceed this limit, they will need to be shortened in this script, in the model files, and in the Kubernetes resource file. Each shortened name should be distinct from other secret names.\nMerging content from the WDT model When a Kubernetes custom resource definition (CRD) file is created for a target environment, content from the corresponding section of the WDT model will be merged into the resulting output, if that section is present.\nFor example, when the -target wko option is used, content from the kubernetes section of the WDT model will be merged into the resulting CRD, if that section is present. For example, you can define this section in the model:\nkubernetes: spec: domainHome: /etc/domainHome image: my-image clusters: - clusterName: my-cluster replicas: 4 - clusterName: other-cluster replicas: 6 These fields will override the values in the output file, and the file would be rewritten with the revised values. List values in the model will be combined with existing values in the output file. For example, if my-cluster was in the original output file, the model content for my-cluster would be merged with it, overriding the replicas value. If my-cluster was not in the original output file, it would be added to the list of clusters.\nWhen creating a resource file for WebLogic Kubernetes Operator version 4.0.0 and later, the kubernetes section of the model has to be structured differently. This is because there are multiple documents in the resource file for those versions. This example uses domain and cluster folders that will merge with the corresponding documents in the resource file:\nkubernetes: domain: spec: domainHome: /etc/domainHome image: my-image clusters: - spec: clusterName: my-cluster replicas: 4 - spec: clusterName: other-cluster replicas: 6 When creating a CRD for Verrazzano, content from the verrazzano section of the WDT model will be merged into the resulting output, similar to the previous examples. Each of the three subsections in the verrazzano section will be merged with the corresponding document in the CRD. This example shows the verrazzano section of the WDT model with its three subsections:\nverrazzano: application: spec: components: - componentName: mydomain-mycomponent traits: - trait: apiVersion: oam.verrazzano.io/v1alpha1 kind: LoggingTrait spec: imagePullPolicy: NEVER weblogic: spec: workload: spec: template: spec: domainHome: /u01/mydomain clusters: - name: cluster2 clusters: - spec: clusterName: cluster2 replicas: 1102 configmap: spec: workload: data: wdt_jdbc.yaml: |resources: JDBCSystemResource: myDs: JdbcResource: JDBCDriverParams: URL: \u0026#34;jdbc:oracle:thin:@myhost:1521/pdborcl\u0026#34; Target environment configuration files A target environment is configured in a JSON file at this location:\n$WLSDEPLOY_HOME/lib/targets/\u0026lt;target-name\u0026gt;/target.json The \u0026lt;target-name\u0026gt; value corresponds to the value of the -target argument on the tool\u0026rsquo;s command line. The WLS installation includes pre-defined targets for these environments:\n WebLogic Kubernetes Operator Verrazzano Kubernetes  You can define a new or extended target environment with a new target-name in the above location, or using a Custom configuration directory, such as $WDT_CUSTOM_CONFIG/target/\u0026lt;my-target-name\u0026gt;/target.json.\nYou can customize existing template files for specific environments. The recommended method is to copy the original template to a custom configuration directory as described above, such as $WDT_CUSTOM_CONFIG/target/\u0026lt;target-name\u0026gt;/model.yaml. The copied file can then be edited as needed, while maintaining the original for reference.\nHere is an example of a target environment file:\n{ \u0026quot;model_filters\u0026quot; : { \u0026quot;discover\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;vz_prep\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;path\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;@@TARGET_CONFIG_DIR@@/vz_filter.py\u0026quot; }, { \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;wko_filter\u0026quot; } ] }, \u0026quot;variable_injectors\u0026quot; : {\u0026quot;PORT\u0026quot;: {},\u0026quot;HOST\u0026quot;: {},\u0026quot;URL\u0026quot;: {}}, \u0026quot;validation_method\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;lax\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;credentials_method\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;secrets\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;exclude_domain_bin_contents\u0026quot;: true, \u0026quot;wls_credentials_name\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;__weblogic-credentials__\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;use_persistent_volume\u0026quot; : true, \u0026quot;additional_secrets\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;runtime-encryption-secret\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;additional_output\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;vz-application.yaml\u0026quot; } Each of the fields in this example is optional, and you can customize them.\nmodel_filters This field specifies the filters to be applied to the resulting model. This follows the same format and rules as the Model filters configuration. The discover type should always be used here.\nYou can use the @@TARGET_CONFIG_DIR@@ token to indicate that the specified filter is in the same directory as the target configuration file.\nvariable_injectors This field specifies the variable injectors to be applied to the resulting model. This follows the same format and rules as the Variable injectors configuration.\nvalidation_method You can use this field to set the validation level for the resulting model. Only the value laxis currently supported. With lax validation, variables and Kubernetes secrets referenced in the resulting model do not need to be available when the model is created.\ncredentials_method This field specifies how credentials in the model should be handled. There are two values available:\n secrets - the credentials in the model are replaced with references to Kubernetes secrets, and a UNIX script to create those secrets is produced. config_override_secrets - the credentials in the model are replaced with placeholder values, such as password1, and a UNIX script to create corresponding Kubernetes secrets is produced.  In both these cases, the script to create the Kubernetes secrets is written to \u0026lt;output-directory\u0026gt;/create_k8s_secrets.sh. You will need to update this script with credential values before executing\nexclude_domain_bin_contents This field specifies how the domain\u0026rsquo;s bin directory contents should be handled. If set to true, then discovery will skip over the domain\u0026rsquo;s bin directory resulting in a model and archive file without any references to any scripts that might typically be collected (for example, setUserOverrides.sh).\nwls_credentials_name This field specifies a name for use with the WDT_MODEL_SECRETS_NAME_DIR_PAIRS environment variable to identify administration credential Secrets for the domain. This is useful when those Secrets are stored in a directory that does not follow the \u0026lt;directory\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;key\u0026gt; convention. For more information about using the WDT_MODEL_SECRETS_NAME_DIR_PAIRS environment variable, see Model tokens.\nuse_persistent_volume This field specifies if the domain is to be created for the Domain in PV domain home source type. If set to true, volume information will be added to the Kubernetes resource file that is generated.\nadditional_secrets This field specifies a comma-separated list of secret types that are to be included in the Kubernetes resource file and the create secrets script. There is one secret type available:\n runtime-encryption-secret - this will add a runtimeEncryptionSecret attribute to the Kubernetes resource file with the value \u0026lt;DOMAIN_UID\u0026gt;-runtime-encryption-secret, and that secret name will be added to the create secrets script.  additional_output You can use this field to create additional output for use in the target environment. The value is a comma-separated list of template files in the $WLSDEPLOY_HOME/lib/targets/templates directory. These templates are populated with information derived from the model, and written to a file with the same name in the specified output directory.\nNote: Prior to release 2.0.1, template files were stored in the $WLSDEPLOY_HOME/lib/targets/\u0026lt;target-name\u0026gt; directory.\n"

	"tags": [],
	"description": "Updates an existing domain and populates the domain with all the resources and applications specified in the model, either in offline or online mode.",
	"content": "The Update Domain Tool uses a model, the archive, and WLST to update the configuration of an existing WebLogic Server domain, and to deploy applications and resources into the domain in either WLST online or offline mode. The Update Domain Tool will add or re-configure elements from the topology section of the model, and deploy applications and resources from the resources and appDeployments sections, as described in the Deploy Applications Tool.\nThe Update Domain Tool will only add or update elements in the specified model. It will not attempt to remove any missing elements that were present in a previous model.\nRunning the Update Domain Tool in WLST offline mode is very similar to running the Create Domain Tool; simply provide the domain location and archive file, and separate model and variable files, if needed. For example:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\updateDomain.cmd -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -domain_type WLS -domain_home domains\\DemoDomain -archive_file DemoDomain.zip -model_file DemoDomain.yaml -variable_file DemoDomain.properties  You can use online mode either on the admin server or from a remote machine. If you are running from the admin server, you can specify domain home directory -domain_home location.\nIf you are running from a remote machine, then you do not need to specify the domain home directory -domain_home option, but there is are limitations:\n Any attribute in the model that referenced a path into the archive file unless the path begins with wlsdeploy/applications or wlsdeploy/sharedLibraries will result in an error, as the tool cannot remotely create such directory or file. For example, if you specify a domainBin: [ wlsdeploy/domainBin/setUserOverrides.sh] which references a file entry in the archive file wlsdeploy/domainBin/setUserOverrides.sh, the tool will fail with an error. Exploded format application specified in the archive is not supported  In WLST online mode, simply add the information on how to connect to the WebLogic Server Administration Server, for example:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\updateDomain.cmd -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -domain_type WLS -domain_home domains\\DemoDomain -archive_file DemoDomain.zip -model_file DemoDomain.yaml -variable_file DemoDomain.properties -admin_url t3://127.0.0.1:7001 -admin_user weblogic  or from a remote machine\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\updateDomain.cmd -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -domain_type WLS -remote -archive_file DemoDomain.zip -model_file DemoDomain.yaml -variable_file DemoDomain.properties -admin_url t3://127.0.0.1:7001 -admin_user weblogic  As usual, the tool will prompt for the password (it can also be supplied by piping it to standard input of the tool). To bypass the prompt, you can use one of two options. Store the password in an environment variable, and use the variable name with command-line option -admin_pass_env. Store the password in a file. Provide the file name with command-line option -admin_pass_file.\nUnlike the Create Domain Tool, the full domain home directory is specified, rather than the domain\u0026rsquo;s parent directory, because the domain has already been established.\nThe Update Domain Tool will not attempt to recreate or add schemas for the RCU database, for domain types that use RCU.\nWhen running the tool in WLST online mode, the update operation may require server restarts or a domain restart to pick up the changes. The update operation can also encounter situations where it cannot complete its operation until the domain is restarted. To communicate these conditions to scripts that may be calling the Update Domain Tool, the shell scripts have two special, non-zero exit codes to communicate these states:\n 103 - The entire domain needs to be restarted. 104 - The domain changes have been canceled because the changes in the model requires a domain restart and -cancel_changes_if_restart_required is specified.  Online update for shared libraries   When updating shared library online, it is recommended to deploy a new version of the library by updating the version(s) in the MANIFEST.MF file and update the deployment descriptor of any application that wants to upgrade to use the new library, this avoids complicated issues like in-place update of shared library.\n  In-place update of shared library online is not supported - if you only update the library contents without updating the version(s) of the library in the MANIFEST.MF file. You will get an error from WebLogic Server indicating the library is referenced by applications and cannot be undeployed. You must undeploy all applications referencing the shared library first before proceeding; this is the same behavior when using the WebLogic Server console. Also, a shared library can potentially be referenced by another shared library module which in turns used by other applications, currently there is no capability within WebLogic Server to handle automating undeploy and deploy of an application that uses shared library when the library is updated in-place.\n  Using output files If the -output_dir command-line argument is specified, the tool will generate output files that provide information about servers and resources that need to be restarted. These files are only applicable for online deployments.\nThe file restart.file contains a list of servers and resources that need to be restarted. Here is an example:\n:AdminServer:Generic1:JDBCSystemResource :AdminServer:: The file non_dynamic_changes.file contains text describing the attributes that will require a restart in order for new values to be applied. Here is an example:\nServer re-start is REQUIRED for the set of changes in progress. The following non-dynamic attribute(s) have been changed on MBeans that require server re-start: MBean Changed : com.bea:Name=AdminServer,Type=Log,Server=AdminServer Attributes changed : RedirectStderrToServerLogEnabled, RedirectStdoutToServerLogEnabled MBean Changed : com.bea:Name=MailSession-0,Type=MailSession Attributes changed : SessionPasswordEncrypted The file results.json contains information about servers and resources need to be restarted, and attribute values that require a restart in order for new values to be applied.\n{ \u0026#34;nonDynamicChanges\u0026#34; : { \u0026#34;com.bea:Name=MailSession-0,Type=MailSession\u0026#34; : [ \u0026#34;SessionPasswordEncrypted\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;com.bea:Name=AdminServer,Type=Log,Server=AdminServer\u0026#34; : [ \u0026#34;RedirectStderrToServerLogEnabled\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;RedirectStdoutToServerLogEnabled\u0026#34; ] }, \u0026#34;nonDynamicChangesText\u0026#34; : [ \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Server re-start is REQUIRED for the set of changes in progress.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;The following non-dynamic attribute(s) have been changed on MBeans\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;that require server re-start:\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;MBean Changed : com.bea:Name=AdminServer,Type=Log,Server=AdminServer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Attributes changed : RedirectStderrToServerLogEnabled, RedirectStdoutToServerLogEnabled\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;MBean Changed : com.bea:Name=MailSession-0,Type=MailSession\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Attributes changed : SessionPasswordEncrypted\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;restarts\u0026#34; : [ { \u0026#34;server\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;AdminServer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;resourceName\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;Generic1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;resourceType\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;JDBCSystemResource\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;server\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;AdminServer\u0026#34; } ] } Using an encrypted model If the model or variables file contains passwords encrypted with the WDT Encryption tool, decrypt the passwords during create with the -use_encryption flag on the command line to tell the Update Domain Tool that encryption is being used and to prompt for the encryption passphrase. As with the database passwords, the tool can also read the passphrase from standard input (for example, stdin) to allow the tool to run without any user input. You can bypass the stdin prompt with two other options. Store the passphrase in an environment variable, and use the environment variable name with command-line option -passphrase_env. Another option is to create a file containing the passphrase value. Pass this filename with the command-line option -passphrase_file.\nUsing multiple models The Update Domain Tool supports the use of multiple models, as described in Using multiple models.\nParameter table for updateDomain    Parameter Definition Default     -admin_pass_env An alternative to entering the admin password at a prompt. The value is an environment variable name that WDT will use to retrieve the password.    -admin_pass_file An alternative to entering the admin password at a prompt. The value is a the name of a file that contains a password string that the tool will read to retrieve the password.    -admin_url The admin server URL for online update.    -admin_user The admin user name for online update.    -archive_file The path to the archive file to use. If the -model_file argument is not specified, the model file in this archive will be used. This can also be specified as a comma-separated list of archive files. The overlapping contents in each archive take precedence over previous archives in the list.    -cancel_changes_if_restart_required Cancel the changes if the update requires domain restart.    -discard_current_edit Discard all existing domain edits before the update.    -domain_home (Required) The location of the existing domain home.    -domain_type The type of domain. (for example, WLS, JRF) WLS   -model_file The location of the model file. This can also be specified as a comma-separated list of model locations, where each successive model layers on top of the previous ones.    -oracle_home Home directory of the Oracle WebLogic installation. Required if the ORACLE_HOME environment variable is not set.    -passphrase_env An alternative to entering the encryption passphrase at a prompt. The value is an environment variable name that WDT will use to retrieve the passphrase.    -passphrase_file An alternative to entering the encryption passphrase at a prompt. The value is a the name of a file with a string value which WDT will read to retrieve the passphrase.    -update_dir If specified, files containing restart information are written to this directory, including restart.file, non_dynamic_changes.file, and results.json.    -use_encryption One or more of the passwords in the model or variables file(s) are encrypted and must be decrypted. Java 8 or later required for this feature.    -variable_home The location of the property file containing the values for variables used in the model. This can also be specified as a comma-separated list of property files, where each successive set of properties layers on top of the previous ones.    -wait_for_edit_lock Skip checks for active edit sessions and pending changes before trying to acquire the WLST online edit lock to modify domain configuration.    -remote Update the domain from a remote machine.

	"title": "Alias definitions",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "WebLogic Deploy Tool uses a set of JSON configuration files to map folders and attributes in the model to the corresponding WLST MBeans and their attributes. These mappings are referred as \u0026lsquo;aliases\u0026rsquo; throughout the project code and documentation. Each element in the alias definition file has detailed properties that assist in this mapping.\nThe model\u0026rsquo;s folder and attribute names usually match the names of the corresponding elements in WLST. For cases where the names of WLST elements may change across WebLogic Server releases, the names should match the names in the 12.2.1.3 release. The unit test AttributesTestCase verifies that this convention is used, and identifies a few exceptions.\nAttributes that are introduced after the 12.2.1.3 release should, in most cases, match the name of the first WebLogic Server release in which they appear. The unit test AttributesTestCase will ignore these for now, because they will not be present in the 12.2.1.3 alias structure.\nThe alias definition files reside in the directory:\n$WLSDEPLOY_HOME/core/src/main/resources/oracle/weblogic/deploy/aliases/category_module\nEach definition file corresponds to a second-level folder within the model, such as JDBCSystemResource. Any elements below a second-level folder are defined in the file of that parent. For example, the model element resources/JDBCSystemResource/JdbcResource/JDBCConnectionPoolParams is described in JDBCSystemResource.json.\nTop-level elements such as topology and resources are for organizational purposes, and are not represented in the alias definition files.\nNo elements in the domainInfo section of the model are represented in the alias definitions, because they don\u0026rsquo;t correspond directly to WLST elements.\nThis example, from the file JDBCSystemResource.json, will be used as a reference in the descriptions below:\n{ \u0026#34;copyright\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Copyright (c) 2017, 2018, Oracle Corporation and/or its affiliates.

Conventions Notations similar to ${Jdbc:JDBC}Resource appear throughout this example, and other alias definition files. It is shorthand for the common situation where a value is different between offline and online WLST. The value before the colon is used in offline processing, and the value after is used for online. In this example, the value for wlst_type is JdbcResource in offline, and JDBCResource in online. This notation can be used for values in most places in the model. It cannot be used for key values, such as wlst_type.\nKeys for top level and folders elements These JSON keys are applicable for the top-level element (such as JDBCSystemResource), and each of its nested folders elements (such as JdbcResource and JdbcResource/JDBCConnectionPoolParams.\nwlst_type This value is the type name of the WLST MBean that corresponds to a model folder. The ${x:y} notation described above is often used here to distinguish offline and online folder names.\nchild_folders_type This value specifies how the tool will map the domain model element to one or more WLST MBeans. The values are:\n  single (default) - this element represents a single MBean, and the MBean name is known.\n  single-unpredictable - this element represents a single MBean, but the MBean name must be derived at runtime.\n  multiple - this element contains multiple named elements (such as dataSource1, dataSource2), and each represents a single MBean.\n  folders Nested WLST MBean types for the current MBean are listed here. Each has a domain model type name, followed by its own JSON keyed elements.\nwlst_attributes_path This key element specifies the name of the path expression used for navigating to the MBean attributes folder. The actual path expression is defined later in the \u0026quot;wlst_paths\u0026quot;: { } element.\nwlst_paths The dictionary key defines the various WLST path values used elsewhere in this folder\u0026rsquo;s definition. Each entry maps a name to a full WLST MBean path. In this example, JDBCConnectionPoolParams has a single path:\n\u0026quot;WP001\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/JDBCSystemResource${:s}/%DATASOURCE%/${Jdbc:JDBC}Resource/%DATASOURCE%/JDBCConnectionPoolParams/${NO_NAME_0:%DATASOURCE%}\u0026quot;\nThe %DATASOURCE% text is token placeholder. It will be replaced with the name of the actual data source by the tool.\nKeys for attributes elements Each child of an attributes element represents a single MBean attribute, and its key is the corresponding model name, such as CapacityIncrement. It contains at least one description element with the JSON keys below. There may be multiple description elements for cases where the configuration varies for different WebLogic Server version ranges, or varies between offline and online WLST.\nversion This key element defines the applicable versions for a particular MBean attribute description. Maven versioning conventions are used to describe ranges and limits. For example:\n\u0026quot;version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;[10,)\u0026quot;\nSpecifies that an MBean attribute description is relevant for WebLogic Server version 10 and later\nwlst_mode This key element specifies the WLST modes that are applicable for an MBean attribute description. The value can be \u0026ldquo;offline\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;online\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;both\u0026rdquo;.\nwlst_name This key element specifies the WLST name of the MBean attribute.\nwlst_type This key element specifies the data type used to set the WLST MBean attribute. Valid values are integer, long, string, delimited_string, boolean and jarray. If the wlst_read_type is not set, this is also the data type used to read the value from WLST.\nwlst_read_type This key element specifies the data type used to read the WLST MBean attribute. If it is not specified, the value of wlst_type is used for the read.\nget_method This key element specifies which method should be used for retrieving the value the MBean attribute. Valid values are:\n GET use the WLST get method to retrieve the value of the attribute LSA use ls(type=\u0026lsquo;a\u0026rsquo;) to retrieve the value of the attribute NONE do not retrieve the attribute value  access By default, an attribute is read write in both WLST and MODEL. This element is used to set an attribute to read-only or ignored. The two attribute values are:\n RO indicates that the attribute is read-only and will not be written into the domain; however, it will be discovered and written into the model by the Discover Domain Tool. IGNORED indicates that the attribute is both known and tolerated in the model but is never discovered or written into the domain.  preferred_model_type This key element specifies the preferred data type that should be used to put data in the model during discovery. As an example, list values can be represented in the model as comma-separated text, such as \u0026quot;value1, value2\u0026quot;, or as a YAML list, such as [\u0026quot;value1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;value2\u0026quot;]. If the list values can contain commas, a YAML list must be used.\nwlst_path This key element specifies the name of the path expression used for navigating to the MBean attribute\u0026rsquo;s folder. This name maps to an entry in the parent folder\u0026rsquo;s \u0026quot;wlst_paths\u0026quot;: { } list.\ndefault_value This key element specifies the default value of the MBean attribute. For example:\n\u0026quot;default_value\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;text\u0026quot;\n\u0026quot;default_value\u0026quot;: 99\n\u0026quot;default_value\u0026quot;: null\n\u0026quot;default_value\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;${__NULL__:1}\u0026quot;\nThe __NULL__ key represents a null value when \u0026quot;${a:b}\u0026quot; notation is used to specify offline and online values.\nset_method For cases where attributes cannot be set with simple types, it may be necessary to use a custom method to set the value. For example, most Target attributes require their values to be set as lists of MBeans, in online mode. This may be defined as:\n\u0026#34;attributes\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Target\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;set_method\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MBEAN.set_target_mbeans\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;set_mbean_type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;weblogic.management.configuration.TargetMBean\u0026#34;} ], }, The method set_target_mbeans directs the tool to call the Jython method attribute_setter.set_target_mbeans to set this value.\nset_mbean_type When a set_method key is specified, it may be required to specify the MBean type for the set method to use (see the example under set_method).\n"

	"content": "Specifying RCU connection information in the model When creating a JRF domain, you can provide all the RCU connection information in a section RCUDbInfo under the domainInfo section in the model. It provides you with more flexibility over the basic command-line arguments of -rcu_db and -rcu_prefix. Use this when the connection string is more complex and requires extra options.\nBackground on JRF domain RCU tables A JRF domain creates several data sources from the JRF domain template.\n   Data source name JNDI name Schema Target     WLSSchemaDataSource jdbc/WLSSchemaDataSource prefix_WLS_RUNTIME None   LocalSvcTblDataSource jdbc/WLSSchemaDataSource prefix_STB admin server   opss-data-source jdbc/OpssDataSource prefix_OPSS admin server and cluster   opss-audit-viewDS jdbc/AuditViewDataSource prefix_IAU_VIEWER admin server and cluster   opss-audit-DBDS jdbc/AuditAppendDataSource prefix_IAU_APPEND admin server and cluster   mds-owsm jdbc/mds/owsm prefix_MDS admin server and cluster    By default, the JRF domain template data source has only the default information such as URL and schema with the default prefix DEV. During domain creation, WDT will use the information you provided in the command line or in the RCUDbinfo section to override the default values from the template so that it can connect to the database you specified.\nFor some advanced use cases, such as using an Oracle Active GridLink data source or Multi Data Sources, you can provide a sparse model of the data sources in a separate model file during domain creation. See Advance use cases.\nCreating a new domain to connect to an existing RCU schema If you ever find a situation where your JRF domain home directory is corrupted or lost, it is possible to create a new domain home directory using the existing RCU schemas provided that you have previously exported the domain\u0026rsquo;s encryption key into an Oracle wallet. To export the encryption key into a wallet, use the OPSS WLST offline exportEncryptionKey function.\nWhen you want to recreate the JRF domain home, you have two options:\n  Use the Create Domain tool\u0026rsquo;s -opss_wallet \u0026lt;path-to-wallet-file\u0026gt; argument and one of the following arguments to pass the wallet passphrase:\n -opss_wallet_passphrase_env \u0026lt;environment-variable-name\u0026gt; - Simply pass the name of the environment variable to read to get the wallet passphrase. -opss_wallet_passphrase_file \u0026lt;path-to-file\u0026gt; - Simply pass the file name for the file containing the wallet passphrase.    Add the OPSS wallet to the archive file in the prescribed location (i.e., wlsdeploy/opsswallet/) using the Archive Helper tool\u0026rsquo;s add opssWallet command and then provide the passphrase in the domainInfo section\u0026rsquo;s OPSSSecrets field.\ndomainInfo: OPSSSecrets: MySecureOPSSWalletPassphrase   Access a database using a wallet When accessing a database, such as ATP or SSL, using a wallet, you need to obtain the wallet from your DBA and information about the database:\n  tns alias - The network service name. You can find this in the tnsnames.ora file inside the database wallet. The alias is on the left side of the equals sign.\nxxxx = (DESCRIPTION ...) yyyy = (DESCRIPTION ...) ...   keystore and truststore password - Password used to generate the wallet.\n  keystore and truststore type - SSO or PKCS12.\n  keystore and truststore file - cwallet.sso (if store type is SSO), ewallet.p12 (if store type is PKCS12).\n  Depending on the type of database and the choice of method for authentication, you can provide the necessary information with RCUDbInfo in the model.\nATP database For example, to use the Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing Cloud Database for a JRF domain, specify the following information in the model:\ndomainInfo: RCUDbInfo: databaseType : \u0026#39;ATP\u0026#39; rcu_prefix : DEV rcu_admin_password: \u0026lt;database admin password is required only when you specify -run_rcu flag\u0026gt; rcu_schema_password : \u0026lt;RCU schema password\u0026gt; rcu_db_user : admin tns.alias : \u0026lt;tns alias name. e.g. dbname_tp\u0026gt;

oracle.net.tns_admin: \u0026lt;absolute path of the unzipped wallet root directory\u0026gt; When using a PKCS12 wallet, you must include the Oracle PKI provider to access your wallet. Add the Oracle PKI provider to your Java java.security file. For more information, see Section 2.2.4 \u0026ldquo;How can Oracle wallets be used in Java\u0026rdquo; in SSL with Oracle JDBC Thin Driver.\nAccess a database without using a wallet (non wallet-based access) For a typical database, use the following example:\ndomainInfo: RCUDbInfo: rcu_prefix : DEV # Optional rcu_db_user for creating RCU schema if -run_rcu flag is specified. Default user is SYS if not specified. # This user must have SYSDBA privilege and this is the equivalent of -dbUser in the RCU utility. rcu_db_user: superuser rcu_schema_password : \u0026lt;rcu schema password, will be prompted if not specified\u0026gt; rcu_admin_password : \u0026lt;database admin password is required only when you specify -run_rcu flag, will be prompted if not specified\u0026gt; rcu_db_conn_string : dbhost:1521/pdborcl Specify variables for RCU RCU -variables option of the repository creation utility can now be included in the RCUDbInfo section with the key rcu_variables:\ndomainInfo: RCUDbInfo: rcu_variables : xxxx Specify extended XML files for RCU When creating a domain using WDT and the -run_rcu option, you can specify your extended XML files in the RCUDbInfo section.\nThis correlates to the createRepository and dropRepository command-line arguments RCU -compInfoXMLLocation \u0026lt;file path\u0026gt; -storageXMLLocation \u0026lt;file path\u0026gt;.\nInclude your XML files in your archive file using the location wlsdeploy/custom/rcu/config.

You will need to update at least the URL, PasswordEncrypted, and the user property value. When you specify the value of URL, it must be a valid JDBC URL format, which is different from the rcu_db_conn_string which does not require the jdbc:oracle:thin:... part.\nresources: JDBCSystemResource: WLSSchemaDataSource: JdbcResource: JDBCConnectionPoolParams: TestTableName: SQL ISVALID MaxCapacity: 75 JDBCDataSourceParams: GlobalTransactionsProtocol: None JNDIName: jdbc/WLSSchemaDataSource JDBCDriverParams: URL: --FIX ME-- PasswordEncrypted: --FIX ME-- DriverName: oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver Properties: user: Value: FMW1_WLS_RUNTIME LocalSvcTblDataSource: Target: admin-server JdbcResource: JDBCConnectionPoolParams: InitialCapacity: 0 CapacityIncrement: 1 TestConnectionsOnReserve: true ConnectionCreationRetryFrequencySeconds: 10 TestTableName: SQL ISVALID TestFrequencySeconds: 300 SecondsToTrustAnIdlePoolConnection: 0 MaxCapacity: 200 JDBCDataSourceParams: GlobalTransactionsProtocol: None JNDIName: jdbc/LocalSvcTblDataSource JDBCDriverParams: URL: --FIX ME-- PasswordEncrypted: --FIX ME-- DriverName: oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver Properties: user: Value: FMW1_STB oracle.net.CONNECT_TIMEOUT: Value: \u0026#39;10000\u0026#39; SendStreamAsBlob: Value: \u0026#39;true\u0026#39; weblogic.jdbc.crossPartitionEnabled: Value: \u0026#39;true\u0026#39; opss-data-source: Target: cluster-1,admin-server JdbcResource: JDBCConnectionPoolParams: TestTableName: SQL ISVALID JDBCDataSourceParams: GlobalTransactionsProtocol: None JNDIName: jdbc/OpssDataSource JDBCDriverParams: URL: --FIX ME-- PasswordEncrypted: --FIX ME-- DriverName: oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver Properties: user: Value: FMW1_OPSS opss-audit-viewDS: Target: cluster-1,admin-server JdbcResource: JDBCConnectionPoolParams: TestTableName: SQL ISVALID JDBCDataSourceParams: GlobalTransactionsProtocol: None JNDIName: jdbc/AuditViewDataSource JDBCDriverParams: URL: --FIX ME-- PasswordEncrypted: --FIX ME-- DriverName: oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver Properties: user: Value: FMW1_IAU_VIEWER opss-audit-DBDS: Target: cluster-1,admin-server JdbcResource: JDBCConnectionPoolParams: TestTableName: SQL ISVALID JDBCDataSourceParams: GlobalTransactionsProtocol: None JNDIName: jdbc/AuditAppendDataSource JDBCDriverParams: URL: --FIX ME-- PasswordEncrypted: --FIX ME-- DriverName: oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver Properties: user: Value: FMW1_IAU_APPEND mds-owsm: Target: cluster-1,admin-server JdbcResource: JDBCConnectionPoolParams: InitialCapacity: 0 TestConnectionsOnReserve: true ConnectionCreationRetryFrequencySeconds: 10 TestTableName: SQL ISVALID TestFrequencySeconds: 300 SecondsToTrustAnIdlePoolConnection: 0 JDBCDataSourceParams: GlobalTransactionsProtocol: None JNDIName: jdbc/mds/owsm JDBCDriverParams: URL: --FIX ME-- PasswordEncrypted: --FIX ME-- DriverName: oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver Properties: user: Value: FMW1_MDS oracle.net.CONNECT_TIMEOUT: Value: \u0026#39;120000\u0026#39; SendStreamAsBlob: Value: \u0026#39;true\u0026#39; Oracle Active Grid Link Data Source (AGL) For setting the data source to access Oracle Active Grid Link database, besides updating the URL, PasswordEncrypted, and the user property value; you can specify additional JDBCOracleParams under JdbcResource of each data source.

Starting with WDT 1.10.0, these additional configuration files can be stored outside the $WLSDEPLOY_HOME/lib directory. This allows the files to remain in place if the WDT installation is moved or upgraded to a new version.\nTo use a separate configuration directory, set the WDT_CUSTOM_CONFIG environment variable to the directory to be used for configuration. For example:\n$ export WDT_CUSTOM_CONFIG=/etc/wdtconfig The customized configuration files should be named and organized the same way they would be under the $WLSDEPLOY_HOME/lib directory. For example:\n/etc/wdtconfig injectors *.json (injector files) typedefs *.json (typedef files) targets my-target target.json *.py (filter files) model_filters.json model_variable_injector.json variable_keywords.json This is a full set of files that can be configured.

	"description": "Adds resources and applications to an existing domain, either in offline or online mode.",
	"content": "The Deploy Applications Tool uses a model, the archive, and WLST to deploy applications and resources into an existing WebLogic Server domain in either WLST online or offline mode. When deploying applications and resources from a model, the Deploy Applications Tool focuses primarily on the resources and appDeployments sections of the model. There are exceptions for the domainInfo and topology sections, where those configuration elements are deemed to be \u0026ldquo;application-related.\u0026rdquo; For example, the servers' ServerStart folder has an Arguments and a ClassPath attribute that change the server environment (when started by the Node Manager) that applications may rely on to function properly. Likewise, the domainInfo section contains a list of JAR files that are to be placed in \u0026lt;DOMAIN_HOME\u0026gt;/lib which are relevant to applications for a similar reason.\nThe Deploy Applications Tool will only add or update elements in the specified model. It will not attempt to remove any missing elements that were present in a previous model.\nIn WLST online mode, the tool tries to minimize the need to redeploy the applications and shared libraries, and the need to restart the server. It does this in a few ways:\n If the model references an application or shared library that is already deployed, the tool compares the binaries to determine whether redeployment is required. Redeployment of shared libraries is particularly expensive since all applications using the shared library must be redeployed\u0026ndash;even if the application has not changed. It looks at the knowledge base to determine which attributes require restart when they are changed. If an attribute requires restart, the tool compares the current and model values to make sure that they are different before trying to apply a change.  The goal is to make the tool both able to support iterative deployment and able to minimize service disruption while doing its work when working against a running domain.\nRunning the Deploy Applications Tool in WLST offline mode is very similar to running the Create Domain Tool; simply provide the domain location and archive file, and separate model and variable files, if needed. For example:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\deployApps.cmd -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -domain_home domains\\DemoDomain -archive_file DemoDomain.zip -model_file DemoDomain.yaml -variable_file DemoDomain.properties  You can use online mode either on the admin server or from a remote machine. If you are running from the admin server, you can specify domain home directory -domain_home location.\nIf you are running from a remote machine with -remote option, then you do not need to specify the domain home directory -domain_home option.\nTo run the tool in online mode, add the -admin_url and -admin_user arguments with the necessary values to connect to the WebLogic Server Administration Server. For example:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\deployApps.cmd -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -domain_home domains\\DemoDomain -archive_file DemoDomain.zip -model_file DemoDomain.yaml -variable_file DemoDomain.properties -admin_url t3://127.0.0.1:7001 -admin_user weblogic  or if running from a remote machine\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\deployApps.cmd -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -remote -archive_file DemoDomain.zip -model_file DemoDomain.yaml -variable_file DemoDomain.properties -admin_url t3://127.0.0.1:7001 -admin_user weblogic  If you are running from a remote machine, then you do not need to specify the domain home directory -domain_home option, but there are limitations:\n Any attribute in the model that referenced a path into the archive file unless the path begins with wlsdeploy/applications or wlsdeploy/sharedLibraries will result in an error, as the tool cannot remotely create such directory or file. For example, if you specify a domainBin: [ wlsdeploy/domainBin/setUserOverrides.sh] which references a file entry in the archive file wlsdeploy/domainBin/setUserOverrides.sh, the tool will fail with an error. Exploded format application specified in the archive is not supported   As usual, the tool will prompt for the password (it can also be supplied by piping it to standard input of the tool). To bypass the prompt, you can use one of two options. Store the password in an environment variable, and use the variable name with command-line option -admin_pass_env. Store the password in a file. Provide the file name with command-line option -admin_pass_file.\nWhen running the tool in WLST online mode, the deploy operation may require server restarts or a domain restart to pick up the changes. The deploy operation can also encounter situations where it cannot complete its operation until the domain is restarted. To communicate these conditions to scripts that may be calling the Deploy Applications Tool, the shell scripts have three special, non-zero exit codes to communicate these states:\n 103 - The entire domain needs to be restarted. 104 - The domain changes have been canceled because the changes in the model requires a domain restart and -cancel_changes_if_restart_required is specified.  Using output files If the -output_dir command-line argument is specified, the tool will generate output files that provide information about servers and resources that need to be restarted. These files are only applicable for online deployments.\nFor more information about these files, see Using output files for the Update Domain Tool.\nUsing an encrypted model If the model or variables file contains passwords encrypted with the WDT Encryption tool, decrypt the passwords during create with the -use_encryption flag on the command line to tell the Deploy Applications Tool that encryption is being used and to prompt for the encryption passphrase. As with the database passwords, the tool can also read the passphrase from standard input (for example, stdin) to allow the tool to run without any user input. You can bypass the stdin prompt with two other options. Store the passphrase in an environment variable, and use the environment variable name with command-line option -passphrase_env. Another option is to create a file containing the passphrase value. Pass this filename using the command-line option -passphrase_file.\nUsing multiple models The Deploy Applications Tool supports the use of multiple models, as described in Using multiple models.\nParameter table for deployApps    Parameter Definition Default     -admin_pass_env An alternative to entering the admin password at a prompt. The value is an environment variable name that WDT will use to retrieve the password.    -admin_pass_file An alternative to entering the admin password at a prompt. The value is a the name of a file that contains a password string that the tool will read to retrieve the password.    -admin_url The admin server URL used for online deploy.    -admin_user The admin user name used for online deploy.    -archive_file The path to the archive file. If the -model_file argument is not used, the model file in this file will be used. This can also be specified as a comma-separated list of archive files. The overlapping contents in each archive take precedence over previous archives in the list.    -cancel_changes_if_restart_required Cancel the changes if the update requires a domain restart.    -discard_current_edit Discard all current domain edits before starting the update.    -domain_home (Required). The location of the existing domain home.    -domain_type The type of domain. (for example, WLS, JRF) WLS   -model_file The location of the model file. This can also be specified as a comma-separated list of model locations, where each successive model layers on top of the previous ones.    -oracle_home Home directory of the Oracle WebLogic installation. Required if the ORACLE_HOME environment variable is not set.    -output_dir If specified, files containing restart information are written to this directory, including restart.file, non_dynamic_changes.file, and results.json.    -passphrase_env An alternative to entering the encryption passphrase at a prompt. The value is an environment variable name that WDT will use to retrieve the passphrase.    -passphrase_file An alternative to entering the encryption passphrase at a prompt. The value is the name of a file with a string value which WDT will read to retrieve the passphrase.    -use_encryption One or more of the passwords in the model or variables file(s) are encrypted and must be decrypted. Java 8 or later is required for this feature.    -variable_file The location of the property file containing the values for variables used in the model. This can also be specified as a comma-separated list of property files, where each successive set of properties layers on top of the previous ones.    -wait_for_edit_lock Skip checks for active edit sessions and pending changes before trying to acquire the WLST online edit lock to modify domain configuration.    -remote Deploy main from a remote machine.

	"description": "",
	"content": "The WebLogic Deploy Tooling has a built-in logging framework based on java.util.logging. Its logging configuration is specified in $WDT_HOME/etc/logging.properties. By default, the logging framework writes to both the console and a log file.\nLog file By default, WDT tools write their log files to the $WDT_HOME/logs directory and the log file name reflects the name of the tool. For example, if you run the validateModel tool then the log file will be $WDT_HOME/logs/validateModel.log. These log files are overwritten each time you run a particular tool so the file contains only the logs from the last tool invocation.\nIf the $WDT_HOME/logs directory is not writable by the user running the tool, the logging framework will search for a location to write the logs. The user must have write permission on the directory in order for it to be selected. The search order is as follows:\n Check the WLSDEPLOY_LOG_DIRECTORY environment variable. Check the current working directory (as defined by the user.dir Java system property) and create a logs subdirectory. Check the temp directory (as defined by the java.io.tmpdir Java system property) and create a wdt-logs subdirectory.  If none of these locations are writable, the logging framework prints an error message to stderr and exits.\nConsole output WDT tools output logging information to stdout and stderr, as appropriate. By default, only INFO level messages are sent to stdout. All WARNING and SEVERE messages are set to stderr. In addition to regular log messages generated as the tool runs, the tools will produce a summary at the end of tool execution that gives the user an overview of the tool execution status. For example, the validateModel tool execution with no warnings or errors will produce output that looks similar to this:\nIssue Log for validateModel version 2.0.0 running WebLogic version 12.2.1.4.0.210930 offline mode: Total: WARNING : 0 SEVERE : 0 Logging levels As mentioned previously, WDT\u0026rsquo;s logging framework is based on java.util.logging so all logging levels defined in the java.utiul.logging.Level class apply to WDT loggers. For a quick review of those levels, see the javadoc.\nWDT uses hierarchical loggers that align with the purpose of the code being executed. The root logger is named wlsdeploy. Many loggers exist underneath the root logger; for example, wlsdeploy.create, wlsdeploy.discover, and wlsdeploy.util. By default, the WDT logging.properties file sets the logging level of the root and several important loggers. If the level for a particular logger is not set, that logger will use the level of its parent logger. This delegation to the parent logger is recursive up the hierarchy until it finds a level to use.\nIn WDT, the log file will collect log entries from all loggers based on the logger\u0026rsquo;s level while the console output is limited to INFO and above only. Log entries written to the console will not display any exception stack traces associated with a log entry. To see those, you must look at the log file. The WDT logging framework supports using the wlsdeploy.debugToStdout Java system property to allow debug log messages (those logged at the FINE level or below) to appear in stdout as long as the loggers to which the messages are logged are not filtering those log levels. For example, doing the following will cause debug output to be written to the console:\nexport WLSDEPLOY_PROPERTIES=-Dwlsdeploy.debugToStdout=true weblogic-deploy/bin/prepareModel.sh ... Log handlers WDT uses several log handlers to handle logging output of data to various sources.\n   Log Handler Output Destination Description     java.util.logging.FileHandler WDT tool log file The standard java.util.logging file handler.   oracle.weblogic.deploy.logging.StdoutHandler stdout WDT handler that writes INFO level messages to the console.   oracle.weblogic.deploy.logging.StderrHandler stderr WDT handler that writes WARNING and SEVERE level messages to the console.   oracle.weblogic.deploy.tooling.SummaryHandler stdout WDT handler that writes the tool\u0026rsquo;s execution summary information to the console.    By default, all four handlers are used and configured appropriately. The logging framework intentionally limits the configurability of these handlers. Only the following logging.properties file settings are allowed.\n   Property Value(s) Allowed Behavior When Set     handlers comma-separated list of handlers The list of handlers to use (removing a handler from the list is the same as setting its level property to OFF).   java.util.logging.FileHandler.level OFF No logging output will be saved in the log file.   oracle.weblogic.deploy.logging.StdoutHandler.level OFF No INFO level logging output will be written to the console.   oracle.weblogic.deploy.logging.StderrHandler.level OFF No WARNING or ERROR level logging output will be written to the console.   oracle.weblogic.deploy.logging.SummaryHandler.level OFF No tool execution summary output will be written to the console.   oracle.weblogic.deploy.logging.SummaryHandler.size Any number Limits the number of memory-buffered WARNING and ERROR log records (default is 3000).    Use the WLSDEPLOY_LOG_HANDLERS environment variable as an alternative to specifying the list of handlers in the logging.properties file\u0026rsquo;s handlers property.\nAny attempts to set other configuration for these log handlers will simply be discarded by the WDT logging framework at startup.\n"

	"description": "Introspects an existing domain and creates a model file describing the domain and an archive file of the binaries deployed to the domain.",
	"content": "The Discover Domain Tool provides a bootstrapping mechanism to creating a model and archive file by inspecting an existing domain and gathering configuration and binaries from it. Note that the model file produced by the tool is not directly usable by the Create Domain Tool or the Deploy Applications Tool because the Discover Domain Tool does not discover the passwords from the existing domain. Instead, it puts a --FIX ME-- placeholder for passwords it finds. Domain users are also not discoverable so the tool injects the same placeholder value in the AdminUserName and AdminPassword fields in the domainInfo section. The idea of this tool is simply to provide a starting point where the user can edit the generated model and archive file to suit their needs for running one of the other tools.\nTo run the Discover Domain Tool, simply provide the Oracle home and domain location. Provide a location and file name for the model file and archive file where the discovered domain information will be written. The model can be generated in either YAML or JSON format. Simply label the file name with the correct suffix. Both a sh and cmd script are provided.\nExample of basic discoverDomain:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\discoverDomain.cmd -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -domain_home domains\\DemoDomain -archive_file DiscoveredDemoDomain.zip -model_file DiscoveredDemoDomain.yaml  When creating the archive, the tool will try to gather all binaries, scripts, and required directories referenced by the domain configuration with the following caveats.\n Any binaries referenced from the ORACLE_HOME will not be gathered, as they are assumed to exist in any target domain to which model-driven operations will be applied. Doing this is key to allowing the model to be WebLogic Server version independent. In its current form, the Discover Domain Tool will only gather binaries and scripts that are accessible from the local machine. Warnings will be generated for any binaries or scripts that cannot be found but the configuration for those binaries will still be collected, where possible. It is the user\u0026rsquo;s responsibility to add those missing files to the archive in the appropriate locations and edit the the model, as needed, to point to those files inside the archive using the relative path inside the archive (for example, wlsdeploy/applications/myapp.ear). You can you run the Discover Domain Tool without generating an archive file if you wish to inspect the model file. A create or update domain requires a valid archive file for any binaries, scripts or directories that will be installed into the domain.  You can customize what is generated in the model for password attributes by providing a variable file location and name. This file is a text properties file which will contain a key=value for each password found in the model. The key is a unique token name for a password attribute, and the value is the replacement value; in this case, an empty string. The attribute in the model is injected with the token name and property field notation. For example, @@PROP:AdminUserName@@ or @@PROP:JDBCSystemResource.\u0026lt;Name\u0026gt;.JdbcResource.JDBCDriverParams.PasswordEncrypted@@.\nA command-line example containing the variable file name:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\discoverDomain.cmd -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -domain_home domains\\DemoDomain -archive_file DiscoveredDemoDomain.zip -model_file DiscoveredDemoDomain.json -variable_file DiscoverDemoDomain.properties  You can use online mode either on the admin server or from a remote machine. If you are running from the admin server, you can specify domain home directory -domain_home location.\nIf you are running from a remote machine, then you do not need to specify the domain home directory -domain_home option\nTo discover the domain using online WLST, simply include the admin user name and admin URL on the command line. The tool will prompt for a password to be entered into STDIN. To bypass the prompt, you can use one of two options. Store the password in an environment variable, and use the variable name with command-line option -admin_pass_env. Store the password value in a file. Provide the file name with command-line option -admin_pass_file.\nAn example of running in online WLST mode from the admin server:\n$ weblogic-deploy/bin/discoverDomain.sh -oracle_home /u01/oracle -domain_home /u01/oracle/domains/DemoDomain -archive_file ./DiscoveredDemoDomain.zip -model_file ./DiscoveredDemoDomain.yaml -admin_user weblogic -admin_url t3://localhost:7001  An example of running in online WLST mode from a remote machine:\n$ weblogic-deploy/bin/discoverDomain.sh -oracle_home /u01/oracle -remote -model_file ./DiscoveredDemoDomain.yaml -admin_user weblogic -admin_url t3://localhost:7001  Note that the command must run on the same system where the domain binaries are located in order to successfully gather the corresponding binaries into the archive file.\nWhen a domain is created using custom or product templates, the templates will install resources into the domain that do not need to be discovered for the model or collected into the archive. The domain type argument, which corresponds to a domain typedef file, must describe the type of domain in order for these resources and files to be ignored. By default, discover runs using domain type WLS, which assumes only the WebLogic Server template was applied to the domain. The tool has canned typedefs for two other domain types, RestrictedJRF and JRF. You may use these domain types, or another custom typedef. For more information, refer to Domain type definitions.\nAn example of using the domain type argument:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\discoverDomain.cmd -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -domain_home domains\\DemoDomain -archive_file DiscoveredDemoDomain.zip -model_file DiscoveredDemoDomain.yaml -domain_type RestrictedJRF  Before the model is persisted to the model file, any variable injectors or model filters are run, in that order. The final step is validation, which validates the contents of the model, archive and variable file. If the validation is successful, the model is persisted. For more information on these three topics, see:\n Variable injection Model filters Validate Model Tool  The resulting model can also be modified for compatibility with specific target environments, such as Oracle WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator. For more information, see Target environments.\nAny problems (or success) will be listed in the Discover Domain Tool summary. The summary will print the version of the tool and Oracle home, and the WLST mode with which the tool was run (online or offline). A recap of all Warning and Severe messages will be listed, along with a total.\nAn example of a summary with a WARNING message:\nIssue Log for discoverDomain version 1.5.2-SNAPSHOT running WebLogic version 10.3.6.0 offline mode: WARNING Messages: 1.

	"description": "Encrypts the passwords in a model (or its variable file) using a user-provided passphrase.",
	"content": " To meet Oracle\u0026rsquo;s security standards, the encryption algorithms require JDK 8 to run.\n Models contain WebLogic Server domain configuration. Certain types of resources and other configurations require passwords; for example, a JDBC data source requires the password for the user establishing the database connection. When creating or configuring a resource that requires a password, that password must be specified either in the model directly or in the variable file. Clear-text passwords are not conducive to storing configurations as source, so the Encrypt Model Tool gives the model author the ability to encrypt the passwords in the model and variable file using passphrase-based, reversible encryption. When using a tool with a model containing encrypted passwords, the encryption passphrase must be provided, so that the tool can decrypt the password in memory to set the necessary WebLogic Server configuration (which supports its own encryption mechanism based on a domain-specific key). While there is no requirement to use the WebLogic Deploy Tooling encryption mechanism, it is highly recommended because storing clear-text passwords on disk is never a good idea.\nThe Create, Update and Deploy tools can take a set of models. The Encrypt model will encrypt a set of models. Each model is encrypted using the same passphrase and written back to its original location.\nWebLogic Deploy Tooling also supports the use of domain-encrypted passwords directly in the model. The Encrypt Model Tool should not be used in tandem with this method.\n Start with the following example model:\ndomainInfo: AdminUserName: weblogic AdminPassword: welcome1 ServerStartMode: prod topology: Name: DemoDomain AdminServerName: AdminServer Cluster: mycluster: Server: AdminServer: ListenAddress: 192.168.1.50 ListenPort: 7001 Machine: machine1 m1: ListenAddress: 192.168.1.50 ListenPort: 8001 Cluster: mycluster Machine: machine1 m2: ListenAddress: 192.168.1.51 ListenPort: 8001 Cluster: mycluster Machine: machine2 Machine: machine1: NodeManager: ListenAddress: 192.168.1.50 ListenPort: 5556 machine2: NodeManager: ListenAddress: 192.168.1.51 ListenPort: 5556 SecurityConfiguration: NodeManagerUsername: weblogic NodeManagerPasswordEncrypted: welcome1 RestfulManagementServices: Enabled: true Security: Group: FriscoGroup: Description: The WLS Deploy development group User: Robert: Password: welcome1 GroupMemberOf: [ Administrators, FriscoGroup ] Derek: Password: welcome1 GroupMemberOf: \u0026#39;Administrators, FriscoGroup\u0026#39; Richard: Password: welcome1 GroupMemberOf: [ FriscoGroup ] Carolyn: Password: welcome1 GroupMemberOf: FriscoGroup Mike: Password: welcome1 GroupMemberOf: FriscoGroup Johnny: Password: welcome1 GroupMemberOf: FriscoGroup Gopi: Password: welcome1 GroupMemberOf: FriscoGroup To run the Encrypt Model Tool on the model, run the following command:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\encryptModel.cmd -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -model_file UnencryptedDemoDomain.yaml  The tool will prompt for the encryption passphrase twice and then encrypt any passwords it finds in the model, skipping any password fields that have variable values, to produce a result that looks like the following model. You can bypass the stdin prompt with two other options. Store the passphrase in an environment variable, and use the environment variable name with command-line option -passphrase_env.

	"description": "Special handling and model semantics for WebLogic Server security configuration.",
	"content": "WebLogic Server security configuration requires special handling and causes the need for the model semantics to differ from other folders. Because provider ordering is important, and to make sure that the ordering is correctly set in the newly created domain, the Create Domain Tool and Update Domain Tool require that all providers be specified in the model for any provider type that will be created or altered. For example, if you want to change one of the providers in the provider type AuthenticationProvider, your model must specify all of the AuthenticationProvider providers and any non-default attributes for those providers. In order to apply security providers, these tools will delete all providers from the target domain for those provider types specified in the model before adding the providers from the model to the target domain. Provider types that are omitted from the model will be unchanged. Example provider types are Adjudicator, AuthenticationProvider, Authorizer, CertPathProvider, CredentialMapper, PasswordValidator, and RoleMapper.\nFor example, if the model specified an LDAPAuthenticator and an LDAPX509IdentityAsserter similar to what is shown below, the DefaultAuthenticator and DefaultIdentityAsserter would be deleted.

Before you can configure this asserter with WLST offline or WDT offline, you must first build the schema file using the prepareCustomProvider script.\nHere is an example of how to prepare and install a schema file from its MBean Jar File (MJF):\n$ export CONFIG_JVM_ARGS=-DSchemaTypeSystemName=TrustServiceIdentityAsserter $ ORACLE_HOME/oracle_common/common/bin/prepareCustomProvider.sh -mjf=ORACLE_HOME/oracle_common/modules/oracle.jps/jps-wls-trustprovider.jar -out ORACLE_HOME/oracle_common/lib/schematypes/jps-wls-trustprovider.schema.jar For FMW versions 12.1.2 and 12.1.3, replace oracle.jps in the example path above with: oracle.jps_12.1.2, or oracle.jps_12.1.3, respectively.\nCustom security providers Creating and updating domains with custom security providers is limited to WebLogic version 12.1.2 and newer.\n Prior to using this tooling to create or update a domain with a custom security provider, there are several prerequisites. First, WebLogic Server requires the custom MBean JAR to be in the Oracle Home directory before it can be configured, WLSERVER/server/lib/mbeantypes. Second, WebLogic Scripting Tool, WLST, requires that the schema JAR be placed in the Oracle Home directory before WLST offline can be used to discover it or configure it, ORACLEHOME/oracle_common/lib/schematypes. Generating an MBean JAR documentation can be found in the WebLogic Server documentation. Generating the schema JAR can be done with the prepareCustomProvider script provided in the WebLogic Server installation.\nFor the MBean jar, WebLogic allows you to define an alternate directory other than WLSERVER/server/lib/mbeantypes by using the system property -Dfmwconfig.alternateTypesDirectory=dir. For the WebLogic MBean schema type jar, you can use an alternate location by using -Dfmwconfig.alternateSchemaDirectory=dir. In order for the custom provider jars to be loaded correctly by WLST when discovering or configuring a domain, set this system property in the WLSDEPLOY_PROPERTIES environment variable. Both of the properties take a comma separated list of paths to directories containing the corresponding type of jar.\nThe format for a custom security provider is slightly different from a built-in provider in that the custom provider must supply the fully-qualified name of the class for the provider in the model between the provider name and the attributes for that provider. Note that the generated Impl suffix is omitted from the name. In the custom CredentialMapper example below, note the location in the model of \u0026lsquo;examples.security.providers.SampleCredentialMapper\u0026rsquo;:\nCredentialMapper: Sample CredentialMapper: examples.security.providers.SampleCredentialMapper: UserNameMapperClassName: examples.security.providers.CredentialMapperProviderImpl CredentialMappingDeploymentEnabled: true Known limitations  Adjudicator provider types cannot be added or modified due to a limitation in WLST. PasswordCredentials provider types cannot be updated in WLST online.  "

The person running the release process must have admin privileges on the WebLogic Deploy Tooling GitHub repo because the release process pushes to the master branch directly. The person running the release process needs to create a GitHub Personal Access Token for the repository with (at least) the repo:status, repo_deployment, public_repo, and security_events privileges. The person running the release process needs a server added to their Maven settings.xml file, where the GitHub Personal Access Token is stored, as shown below.

For example, mvn -B -DdevelopmentVersion=3.2.0-SNAPSHOT release:prepare release:perform. If your SSH private key has a passphrase, watch the build closely because it will prompt for your passphrase multiple times. Failure to enter it in a timely manner may result in a failure.    If the build fails, run the mvn -B release:rollback command to undo it and start over from Step 2., after correcting the issue.\n  After the software has been released, move on to the GitHub Release Process.\n  GitHub release process Note that this process relies on the WDT installers being in your local Maven repository. As such, it is critical for the same user to run these steps on the same machine as the steps from the previous section!\n Save the release notes in the file \u0026lt;wdt-project-directory\u0026gt;/target/ReleaseNotes.md. Run the command mvn -f github-release.xml -DreleaseVersion=\u0026lt;release version number\u0026gt; verify to create the draft GitHub Release. Log into GitHub, go to the Releases page, review/edit the draft release, and then publish the release.  "

	"description": "Establishing users, groups, and global roles as part of WebLogic domain creation.",
	"content": "WebLogic Server has the ability to establish a set of users, groups, and global roles as part of the WebLogic domain creation. The WebLogic global roles become part of the WebLogic role mapper (for example, XACMLRoleMapper) and are specified under domainInfo in the WLSRoles section. The users and groups become part of the Embedded LDAP server (for example, DefaultAuthenticator) and are specified under topology in the Security section.\nWebLogic global roles The model allows for the definition of WebLogic roles that can augment the well known WebLogic global roles (for example, Admin, Deployer, Monitor, \u0026hellip;) in addition to defining new roles. When updating the well known WebLogic roles, an UpdateMode can be specified as { append | prepend | replace } with the default being replace when not specified. Also, when updating the well known roles, the specified Expression will be a logical OR with the default expression. The Expression value for the role is the same as when using the WebLogic RoleEditorMBean for a WebLogic security role mapping provider.\nFor example, the WLSRoles section below updates the well known Admin, Deployer and Monitor roles while adding a new global role with Tester as the role name:\ndomainInfo: WLSRoles: Admin: UpdateMode: append Expression: \u0026#34;?weblogic.entitlement.rules.IDCSAppRoleName(AppAdmin,@@PROP:AppName@@)\u0026#34; Deployer: UpdateMode: replace Expression: \u0026#34;?weblogic.entitlement.rules.AdministrativeGroup(@@PROP:Deployers@@)\u0026#34; Monitor: UpdateMode: prepend Expression: \u0026#34;?weblogic.entitlement.rules.AdministrativeGroup(AppMonitors)\u0026#34; Tester: Expression: \u0026#34;?weblogic.entitlement.rules.IDCSAppRoleName(AppTester,@@PROP:AppName@@)\u0026#34; The Admin role will have the expression appended to the default expression, the Deployer role expression will replace the default, the Monitor role expression will be prepended to the default expression and Tester will be a new role with the specified expression.\nIn addition, the Expression value can use the variable placeholder syntax specified when running the Create Tool as shown in the above example.\nWebLogic users and groups The model allows for the definition of a set of users and groups that will be loaded into the WebLogic Embedded LDAP Server (for example, DefaultAuthenticator). New groups can be specified and users can be added as members of the new groups or existing groups such as the Administrators group which is defaulted to be in the WebLogic Admin global role. Please see Known Limitations below for additional information on users and groups.\nThe user password can be specified with a placeholder or encrypted with the Encrypt Tool. An example Security section that adds an additional group AppMonitors, adds two new users and places the users into groups is as follows:\nYou can add user attributes that are defined for the DefaultAuthenticator. This is a limited set of attributes that go under a separate folder UserAttribute in the model under the User section.\ntopology: Security: Group: AppMonitors: Description: Application Monitors User: john: Password: welcome1 GroupMemberOf: [ AppMonitors, Administrators ] joe: Password: welcome1 GroupMemberOf: [ AppMonitors ] UserAttribute: mail: joe@mycompany.com Known limitations  The processing of users, groups, and roles will only take place when using the Create Domain Tool. WebLogic global roles are only supported with WebLogic Server version 12.2.1 or greater. WebLogic global roles are only updated for the WebLogic security XACML role mapping provider (for example, XACMLRoleMapper). The user and group processing is not complete, currently, users cannot be assigned to groups. Users created using the Security section are automatically added to the Administrators group and are not added to the groups specified.

	"content": "When working with a metadata model that drives tooling, it is critical to make it easy both to validate that the model and its related artifacts are well-formed and to provide help on the valid attributes and subfolders for a particular model location. The Validate Model Tool provides both validation and help for model authors as a standalone tool. In addition, the tool is integrated with the createDomain and deployApps tools to catch validation errors early, before any actions are performed on the domain.\nTo use the Validate Model Tool, simply run the validateModel shell script with the correct arguments. To see the list of valid arguments for any tool in the WebLogic Deploy Tooling installation, simply run the shell script with the -help option (or with no arguments) to see the shell script usage information.\nFor example, starting with the following model shown below, where the AdminServer attribute Machine is misspelled as Machines:\ntopology: Name: DemoDomain AdminServerName: AdminServer Cluster: mycluster: Server: AdminServer: ListenAddress: 192.168.1.50 ListenPort: 7001 Machines: machine1 SSL: Enabled: true ListenPort: 7002 ServerStart: ClassPath: c:\\foo\\bar m1: ListenAddress: 192.168.1.50 ListenPort: 8001 Cluster: mycluster Machine: machine1 ServerStart: ClassPath: c:\\foo\\bar m2: ListenAddress: 192.168.1.51 ListenPort: 8001 Cluster: mycluster Machine: machine2 ServerStart: ClassPath: c:\\foo\\bar Machine: machine1: NodeManager: ListenAddress: 192.168.1.50 ListenPort: 5556 machine2: NodeManager: ListenAddress: 192.168.1.51 ListenPort: 5556 To validate the standalone model file, run the tool as follows:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\validateModel.cmd -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -model_file InvalidDemoDomain.yaml  The output of the tool will look something like this:\n----------------------------------------------- Validation Area: topology Section ----------------------------------------------- Errors: 1 Message: Machines is not one of the folder, folder instance or attribute names allowed in model location topology:/Server/AdminServer  Use the Model Help Tool to determine the valid list of attributes and folders at this model location.\nIf the model contains variable definitions and the variable file or files is specified, the Validate Model Tool will validate that all variable references in the model are defined in the variable files. For example, invoking the tool as shown here:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\validateModel.cmd -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -model_file InvalidDemoDomain.yaml -variable_file InvalidDemoDomain.properties  Results in output similar to that shown below, if the db.password variable is not defined in the variable file.\n----------------------------------------------- Validation Area: Variable Substitutions ----------------------------------------------- Errors: 2 Message: Model location resource:/JDBCSystemResource/Generic1/JdbcResource/JDBCDriverParams/PasswordEncrypted references variable db.password that is not defined in D:/demo/InvalidDemoDomain.properties Message: Model location resource:/JDBCSystemResource/Generic2/JdbcResource/JDBCDriverParams/PasswordEncrypted references variable db.password that is not defined in D:/demo/InvalidDemoDomain.properties  If the model references binaries that should be present in the archive, the Validate Model Tool will validate that all binary references in the model that point to archive file locations are present in the archive file. For example, invoking the tool as shown here:\n$ weblogic-deploy\\bin\\validateModel.cmd -oracle_home c:\\wls12213 -model_file InvalidDemoDomain.yaml -archive_file InvalidDemoDomain.zip  Results in output similar to that shown below, if the simpleear.ear file is not in the model-specified location inside the archive file.\n----------------------------------------------- Validation Area: Archive Entries ----------------------------------------------- Errors: 1 Message: Model location appDeployments:/Application/simpleear/SourcePath references file wlsdeploy/applications/simpleear.ear that is not found in the archive file D:/demo/InvalidDemoDomain.zip  Using multiple models The Validate Model Tool supports the use of multiple models, as described in Using multiple models.\nParameter table for validateModel    Parameter Definition Default     -archive_file The path to the archive file to use. If the archive file is not provided, validation will only validate the artifacts provided. This can also be specified as a comma-separated list of archive files. The overlapping contents in each archive take precedence over previous archives in the list.    -domain_type The type of domain. (for example, WLS, JRF) WLS   -model_file The location of the model file to use. This can also be specified as a comma-separated list of model locations, where each successive model layers on top of the previous ones. If not specified, the tool will look for the model in the archive. If the model is not found, validation will only validate the artifacts provided.    -oracle_home Home directory of the Oracle WebLogic installation. Required if the ORACLE_HOME environment variable is not set.    -target_mode The target WLST mode that the tool should use to validate the model content. The only valid values are online or offline. offline   -target_version The target version of WebLogic Server the tool should use to validate the model content. This version number can be different than the version being used to run the tool. Oracle home version   -variable_file The location of the property file containing the variable values for all variables used in the model.

The original value is:\n\u0026quot;extensionTemplates\u0026quot;: [ \u0026quot;Oracle Restricted JRF\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Oracle Enterprise Manager-Restricted JRF\u0026quot; ], The revised value would be:\n\u0026quot;extensionTemplates\u0026quot;: [ \u0026quot;Oracle Restricted JRF\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Oracle Enterprise Manager-Restricted JRF\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Oracle HTTP Server (Restricted JRF)\u0026quot; ], The file name of this new domain type (without the .json extension) is used with the -domain_type argument on the WDT command line. For example, the command line to create a domain using the HttpServer.json file from the previous steps would look like:\n$ WLSDEPLOY_HOME/bin/createDomain -oracle_home /etc/oracle ... -domain_type HttpServer Configuring the model Configuring OHS typically involves adding two top-level folders to the resources section of the model, SystemComponent and OHS. Here is an example:\nresources: SystemComponent: my-ohs: ComponentType: OHS Machine: my-machine OHS: my-ohs: AdminHost: 127.0.0.1 AdminPort: 9324 ListenAddress: 127.0.0.1 ListenPort: 7323 SSLListenPort: 4323 ServerName: http://localhost:7323 Each name under the OHS folder must match a name under the SystemComponent folder in the model, or the name of a SystemComponent element that has been previously created. In this example, the name my-ohs is in both places.\nThe ComponentType field of the SystemComponent element must be set to OHS in order to allow configuration of the corresponding OHS folders.\nYou can use the Model Help Tool to determine the complete list of folders and attributes that can be used in these sections of the model. For example, this command will list the attributes in the OHS folder:\n$ ${WDT_HOME}/bin/modelHelp.sh -oracle_home /tmp/oracle resources:/OHS "

	"content": "Using WDT with WebLogic Kubernetes Operator You can use the Extract Domain Resource Tool to create resource files for use with the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator or Verrazzano. This allows the domain configuration and the Kubernetes container configuration to be specified in a single model file.\nThis is especially useful when making configuration changes to the domain that also need to be reflected in the resource file. For example, adding a cluster to the domain only requires that it be added to the topology section of the WDT model, then a new resource file can be generated to apply to Kubernetes.\nMore information about the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator can be found here.\nMore information about Verrazzano can be found here.\nHere is an example command line for the Extract Domain Resource Tool:\n$ \u0026lt;wls-deploy-home\u0026gt;/bin/extractDomainResource.sh -oracle_home /tmp/oracle -domain_home /u01/mydomain -model_file /tmp/mymodel.yaml -variable_file /tmp/my.properties -output_dir /tmp/resource -target wko For the simplest case, the Extract Domain Resource Tool will create resource files based on the templates corresponding to the target argument, using information from the command line and the domain sections of the model. Information about target types and templates can be found here.\nThe value of the optional -domain_home argument will be applied in the template output. Domain name and UID fields in the template will use the domain name in the topology section of the model, or the default base_domain. The cluster entries will be pulled from the topology section of the model; their replica counts will have been derived from the number of servers for each cluster.\nThe user is expected to fill in the image and secrets information identified by --FIX ME-- in the resource output.\nFor more advanced configurations, including pre-populating the --FIX ME-- values, the user can populate the related section of the WDT model, and those values will appear in the resulting custom resource definition (CRD) resource files. In this example the kubernetes section of the model overrides and adds some values to the CRD generated for WebLogic Kubernetes Operator.\nkubernetes: metadata: name: myName namespace: myNamespace spec: image: \u0026#39;my.repo/my-image:2.0\u0026#39; imagePullSecrets: - name: WEBLOGIC_IMAGE_PULL_SECRET_NAME webLogicCredentialsSecret: name: \u0026#39;@@PROP:mySecret@@\u0026#39; configuration: model: domainType: \u0026#39;WLS\u0026#39; secrets: - secret1 - secret2 serverPod: env: - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: \u0026#39;-XX:+UseContainerSupport -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom\u0026#39; - name: JAVA_OPTIONS value: \u0026#39;-Dmydir=/home/me\u0026#39; This example uses @@PROP:mySecret@@ to pull the value for webLogicCredentialsSecret from the variables file specified on the command line. This can be done with any of the values in the CRD sections of the model. More details about using model variables can be found here.\nUsing the wko target with this example, the resulting domain resource file would contain:\napiVersion: weblogic.oracle/v8 kind: Domain metadata: name: myName namespace: myNamespace spec: image: \u0026#39;my.repo/my-image:2.0\u0026#39; imagePullSecrets: - name: WEBLOGIC_IMAGE_PULL_SECRET_NAME webLogicCredentialsSecret: name: WEBLOGIC_CREDENTIALS_SECRET_NAME serverPod: env: - name: USER_MEM_ARGS value: \u0026#39;-XX:+UseContainerSupport -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom\u0026#39; - name: JAVA_OPTIONS value: \u0026#39;-Dmydir=/home/me\u0026#39; domainHome: /u01/mine/domain configuration: model: domainType: WLS secrets: - secret1 - secret2 clusters: - clusterName: mycluster replicas: 2 - clusterName: mycluster3 replicas: 4 If clusters are specified in the kubernetes/spec section of the model, those clusters will be combined with any clusters from the topology section of the model.\nIf the WDT model has a value of Never for spec/imagePullPolicy, the imagePullSecrets default value will not be added.\nA full list of sections and variables supported by the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator is available here. The Extract Domain Resource Tool supports a subset of these sections, including metadata, serverPod, and spec.\nThe verrazzano section of the WDT model can be used to update the CRDs generated for Verrazzano targets, such as vz and vz-dii. More information about this model section can be found here.\nThe Model Help Tool can be used to determine the folders and attributes that can be used in the CRD sections of the model. For example, this command will list the folders and attributes in the spec folder in the kubernetes section:\n\u0026lt;wls-deploy-home\u0026gt;/bin/modelHelp.sh -oracle_home /tmp/oracle kubernetes:/spec This command will list the folders and attributes in the application/spec folder in the verrazzano section:\n\u0026lt;wls-deploy-home\u0026gt;/bin/modelHelp.sh -oracle_home /tmp/oracle -target vz verrazzano:/application/spec The content for the CRD sections is not generated when a model is discovered by the Discover Domain Tool.\nParameter table for extractDomainResource    Parameter Definition Default     -archive_file The path to the archive file. This can also be specified as a comma-separated list of archive files. The overlapping contents in each archive take precedence over previous archives in the list.    -domain_home The domain home directory to be used in output files. This will override any value in the model.    -model_file The location of the model file. This can also be specified as a comma-separated list of model locations, where each successive model layers on top of the previous ones.    -oracle_home Home directory of the Oracle WebLogic installation. Required if the ORACLE_HOME environment variable is not set.    -output_dir The location for the target output files.    -target The target output type. The default is wko. For more information about target types, see Target Environments.    -variable_file The location of the property file containing the values for variables used in the model.

	"title": "Variable Injector Tool",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "Adds token to a model with variables.",
	"content": "The Variable Injector Tool is used to tokenize a model with variables. The values for these variables are assigned using an external property file. This facilitates using the same domain model to create new domains in different environments. The Variable Injector Tool can be run as an option in the Discover Domain Tool, or from the standalone command-line interface.\nTo enable the Variable Injector Tool during the Discover Domain Tool run, create a variable injector configuration by placing a JSON file named model_variable_injector.json into the \u0026lt;WLSDEPLOY\u0026gt;/lib directory using one or more of the pre-defined keywords and/or a CUSTOM list of files.\nAnother option is to configure variable injection in a Custom configuration directory. Create the model_variable_injector.json file in the $WDT_CUSTOM_CONFIG directory.\nA keyword points to an injector directive file. The tool applies the directives to the attributes in a model, and if the directive matches an attribute, then a property token with a unique variable name is injected into the model and replaces the attribute value. The variable name and model attribute value are placed into the external variable properties file.\nVariable injection on an attribute is only performed once. The property token is not replaced by any subsequent matches.\n If variable injection is enabled, the Discover Domain Tool calls the variable injector after the model has been discovered and after all filters run, but before model validation.\nThe supported keywords are as follows:\n CREDENTIALS - All MBean credentials attribute values (user and password) are injected with a variable. HOST - All MBean host attribute values in the model are injected with a variable. PORT - All MBean port attribute values in the model are injected with a variable. TARGET - All MBean target attribute values in the model are injected with a variable. TOPOLOGY - Common environmental MBean attributes found in the topology section of the model are injected with a variable. This includes server, machine and Node Manager ports, credentials and listen addresses, and cluster messaging modes, addresses and ports. URL - All MBean URL attribute values in the model are injected with a variable.  The directives used by each pre-defined keyword are defined in an injector JSON file that is located in the \u0026lt;WLSDEPLOY\u0026gt;/lib/injectors folder. These files should not be changed, but could be used as is.\n Here is an example of a model_variable_injector.json file using the PORT keyword.\n{ \u0026#34;PORT\u0026#34;: {} } Below is a model snippet that shows injected variables in the port attributes.\ntopology: Name: soa_domain AdminServerName: AdminServer Cluster: soa_cluster: osb_cluster: Server: AdminServer: ListenAddress: myadmin.example.com ListenPort: @@PROP:Server.AdminServer.ListenPort@@ Machine: machine1 SSL: Enabled: true ListenPort: @@PROP:Server.SSL.AdminServer.ListenPort@@ soa_server1: ListenAddress: managed1.example.com ListenPort: @@PROP:Server.soa_server1.ListenPort@@ Cluster: soa_cluster Machine: machine2 SSL: Enabled: true ListenPort: @@PROP:Server.SSL.soa_server1.ListenPort@@ soa_server2: ListenAddress: managed2.example.com ListenPort: @@PROP:Server.soa_server2.ListenPort@@ Cluster: soa_cluster Machine: machine3 SSL: Enabled: true ListenPort: @@PROP:Server.SSL.soa_server2.ListenPort@@ And the resulting variable property file:\nServer.AdminServer.ListenPort=7001 Server.AdminServer.SSL.ListenPort=7002 Server.soa_server1.ListenPort=8001 Server.soa_server1.SSL.ListenPort=8002 Server.soa_server2.ListenPort=8001 Server.soa_server2.SSL.ListenPort=8002 To specify the name and location of the variable properties file for the Discover Domain Tool, use the argument -variable_properties_file on the command line. Usage of the -variable_properties_file argument without the presence of the model variable injector file in the \u0026lt;WLSDEPLOY\u0026gt;/lib directory will cause an error condition and the tool will exit. If the model variable injector file exists in the directory, but the command-line argument is not used, the variable properties file is created with the following defaults:\n If the -model_file command-line argument is used on the Discover Domain Tool run, the properties file name and location will be the same as the model file, with the file extension .properties. If only the archive file argument is present, the archive file name and location will be used.  As with the archive and model file, each run of the Discover Domain Tool will overwrite the contents of an existing variable property file with the values from the current run.\nCustom variable injector To designate custom injector directives, use the CUSTOM keyword in the model_variable_injector.json file. The CUSTOM keyword requires a list of one or more custom injector directive JSON files.\nAn injector directive contains a key that identifies an attribute to be tokenized, and an optional set of directive properties. The key is a period-separated MBean hierarchy and attribute name as they are defined in the model. Always exclude the name of the model section from the injector key.\nFor example, an injector key for the Server SSL Listen Port is as below. This directive contains no additional properties.\n{ \u0026#34;Server.SSL.ListenPort\u0026#34;: {} } NOTE: The hierarchy of MBeans in the model for the ListenPort attribute. Note that the MBean name of AdminServer is NOT included in the directive:\ntopology: Server: AdminServer: ListenAddress: myadmin.example.com ListenPort: 7001 Machine: machine1 SSL: Enabled: true ListenPort: 7002 These custom injector JSON files will be processed by the Variable Injector Tool before keywords, each file processed in list order. A property injected into an attribute will not be replaced by any subsequent matches.\nCustom directive properties Include the following properties to refine the directive as specified.\n  force:\u0026lt;attribute\u0026gt; If the MBean hierarchy exists in the model, but the attribute does not, then the attribute will be added and persisted to the discovered model. The value stored in the model is the WebLogic default value.\n  variable_value: Replace the model value with the specified value in the variable properties. This may be used in conjunction with the force directive, replacing the default value with the indicated value.\n  regexp: A list of regexp patterns that will be applied to either the string values or map values of an attribute in the model. If the pattern matches, then the matching part of the string or dictionary will be injected with a property token and a unique variable name.\n  pattern: The regular expression pattern to apply to the string value or map values of an attribute.\n  suffix: The suffix name to append to each resulting variable name in order to create a unique variable name.\n    The regexp list is useful when only a segment of a string value or map needs to be tokenized (giving you a clean list of property values in the variable properties file). You can inject more than one token into a string or map with multiple patterns. However, when you have more than one pattern, you must provide a suffix for each. This allows the tool to generate a unique variable name for each token in the string or map.\nThe following is an example of how to effectively use the regexp directive list to search for a segment in a string value. In this example, we want to search for the host and port in each Oracle JDBC URL that uses the special Oracle URL notation, and create an entry for the host and port in the variable properties file.\nIn the model, we expect to find a URL like the following:\nJDBCSystemResource: Database1: JdbcResource: JDBCDriverParams: URL: \u0026#39;jdbc:oracle:thin:@(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS_LIST=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=slc05til.us.oracle.com)(PORT=1521)))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=orcl.us.oracle.com)))\u0026#39; We create a directive in our custom injector JSON file:\n\u0026#34;JDBCSystemResource.JdbcResource.JDBCDriverParams.URL\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;regexp\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;pattern\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;(?\u0026lt;=PORT=)[\\\\w.-]+(?=\\\\))\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;suffix\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Port\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;pattern\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;(?\u0026lt;=HOST=)[\\\\w.-]+(?=\\\\))\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;suffix\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Host\u0026#34; } ] }, During the Discover Domain Tool run, the pattern is applied to the URL string and tokens injected into the string:\nURL: 'jdbc:oracle:thin:@(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS_LIST=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=@@PROP:JDBCSystemResource.Database1.JdbcResource.JDBCDriverParams.URL--Host@@:)(PORT=@@PROP:JDBCSystemResource.Database1.JdbcResource.JDBCDriverParams.URL--Port@@)))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=orcl.us.oracle.com)))' And the variables put in the properties file:\nJDBCSystemResource.Database1.JdbcResource.JDBCDriverParams.URL--Host=slc05til.us.oracle.com JDBCSystemResource.Database1.JdbcResource.JDBCDriverParams.URL--Port=1521 Selecting specific MBean names for variable injection This final custom directive allows you to explicitly define which named entries for an MBean in the model you want to inject properties. For instance, you might want to tokenize an attribute just for a specific server. To define a list of one or more names for a specific MBean in the injector directive hierarchy, format the list as follows:\nMBean[comma separated list of names] To select only the Administration Server named AdminServer for a Server directive, use the format Server[AdminServer]. To select servers soa_server1 and soa_server2, format the key as Server[soa_server1,soa_server2].\nThe injector tool recognizes two KEYWORDS for a user list, MANAGED_SERVERS (all the Managed Servers in the model) and ADMIN_SERVER (the Administration Server in the model).\nA custom injector for the Administration Server SSL listen port is:\n{ \u0026#34;Server[ADMIN_SERVER].SSL.ListenPort\u0026#34;: {}, } Variable injector sample A sample of a model_variable_injector.json file and a custom injector JSON file are installed in the WLSDEPLOY/samples directory.\nParameter table for injectVariables    Parameter Definition Default     -archive_file The path to the archive file that contains a model in which the variables will be injected. If the -model_file argument is used, this argument will be ignored.    -model_file The location of the model file in which variables will be injected. If not specified, the tool will look for the model in the archive file. Either the -model_file or the -archive_file argument must be provided.    -oracle_home Home directory for the Oracle WebLogic installation. This is required unless the ORACLE_HOME environment variable is set.    -variable_injector_file The location of the variable injector file which contains the variable injector keywords for this model injection run. If this argument is not provided, the model_variable_injector.json file must exist in the lib directory in the WLSDEPLOY_HOME location.    -variable_properties_file The location of the property file in which to store any variable names injected into the model. If this command-line argument is not specified, the variable will be located and named based on the model file or archive file name and location. If the file exists, the file will be updated with new variable values.     "

The -model_sample argument is deprecated starting with WebLogic Deploy Tooling 1.9.2, when model sample became the default output format.\n Here is a simple example using the Model Help Tool:\n$ \u0026lt;wls-deploy-home\u0026gt;/bin/modelHelp.sh -oracle_home /tmp/oracle resources:/JDBCSystemResource This will result in the following output:\nAttributes and sub-folders for resources:/JDBCSystemResource resources: JDBCSystemResource: \u0026#39;JDBC-1\u0026#39;: CompatibilityName: # string + DeploymentOrder: # integer (default=100) + DeploymentPrincipalName: # string + DescriptorFileName: # string + ModuleType: # string + Notes: # string + SourcePath: # string + Target: # delimited_string + JdbcResource: # see /JDBCSystemResource/JdbcResource SubDeployment: \u0026#39;SubDeployment-1\u0026#39;: # see /JDBCSystemResource/SubDeployment This bean defines a system-level JDBC resource.

A plus sign (+) on an attribute indicates that appending the attribute to the model path will yield more information about the attribute.\nFolders that support multiple instances, such as JDBCSystemResource in this example, are shown with a derived name, such as 'JDBC-1'.\nEach sub-folder includes a comment with a model path that can be used to display additional information about that sub-folder. For example, to determine the attributes and sub-folders for 'SubDeployment-1', the Model Help Tool could be re-invoked with the model path from the comment:\n$ \u0026lt;wls-deploy-home\u0026gt;/bin/modelHelp.sh -oracle_home /tmp/oracle -model_sample /JDBCSystemResource/SubDeployment You can use the information above to construct this model section:\nresources: JDBCSystemResource: JDBC-1: # JDBCSystemResource attributes and folders CompatibilityName: myName DeploymentOrder: 5 Target: ms1,ms2 SubDeployment: deployment1: # SubDeployment attributes and folders deployment2: # SubDeployment attributes and folders If you are copying elements from the sample model to create a full domain model, you should exclude any attributes or sub-folders that you do not intend to declare or override.\nPath patterns There are a number of ways to specify model location in the path argument. Here are some examples:\nList all the top-level model sections, such as topology, resources, and such:\ntop List the attributes and folders within a section, such as topology, resources, and such:\ntopology List all the attributes and folders within a folder:\nresources:/JDBCSystemResource/JdbcResource If the section is not provided for a folder, then it will be derived and included in the output text:\n/JDBCSystemResource/JdbcResource Per attribute help To show help for a particular attribute in a folder, simply add it to the model path.\nFor example:\n$ modelHelp.sh topology:/Server/Log/StdoutSeverity The output is:\nAttributes and sub-folders for topology:/Server/Log/StdoutSeverity topology: Server: \u0026#39;Server-1\u0026#39;: Log: StdoutSeverity: # string Default=Notice Legal values: \u0026#39;Trace\u0026#39; \u0026#39;Debug\u0026#39; \u0026#39;Info\u0026#39; \u0026#39;Warning\u0026#39; \u0026#39;Error\u0026#39; \u0026#39;Notice\u0026#39; \u0026#39;Critical\u0026#39; \u0026#39;Alert\u0026#39; \u0026#39;Emergency\u0026#39; \u0026#39;Off\u0026#39; The minimum severity of log messages going to the standard out. Messages with a lower severity than the specified value will not be published to standard out. Output options There are several command-line options that you can use to control the output text for the model path. Use only one of these options at a time. If no output options are specified, then the attributes and immediate sub-folders for the specified path are listed.\nWhen the top sections are listed using the path top, any output options are ignored.\n -attributes_only This option will list only the attributes for the specified path.\n-folders_only This option will list only the immediate sub-folders for the specified path.\n-recursive This option will recursively list all the sub-folders within the specified path. No attributes are listed.\nHere is an example using the -recursive option:\n$ \u0026lt;wls-deploy-home\u0026gt;/bin/modelHelp.sh -oracle_home /tmp/oracle -recursive resources:/JDBCSystemResource The output is:\nRecursive sub-folders only for resources:/JDBCSystemResource resources: JDBCSystemResource: \u0026#39;JDBC-1\u0026#39;: JdbcResource: JDBCConnectionPoolParams: JDBCDataSourceParams: JDBCDriverParams: Properties: \u0026#39;Properties-1\u0026#39;: JDBCOracleParams: JDBCXAParams: SubDeployment: \u0026#39;SubDeployment-1\u0026#39;: Interactive option To access an interactive command line for exploring model paths using a directory style syntax, use modelHelp.sh -interactive \u0026lt;starting_model_path\u0026gt;.\nFor example:\n$ modelHelp.sh -interactive top The output is:\nIn interactive mode!

When the wallet is added as a ZIP file, the createDomain and updateDomain tools will expand the ZIP into the domain home, just as before.\n  #1348: Added database wallet support for multiple wallets. Other database wallets can be added, as needed. (WDT-710)\n  #1351: Removed support for the deprecated \u0026ldquo;named object list\u0026rdquo; format from the kubernetes section of the model. (WDT-688)\n  #1366: Refactored ATP and SSL database support to be more unified in their modeling approach.\n  #1369: Added a special log level for deprecation messages so that they can show up in the tools' summary reports without causing a non-zero exit status.

	"content": "WebLogic Deploy Tooling WebLogic Deploy Tooling (WDT) makes it easy to stand up WebLogic environments and perform domain lifecycle operations in a repeatable fashion based on a metadata model that can be treated as source and evolve as the project evolves.\nMany organizations use WebLogic Server, with or without other Oracle Fusion Middleware components, to run their enterprise applications. And, as more and more of these organizations move toward Continuous Delivery of their applications, the importance of automated configuration application deployment grows. This automation is often implemented using the WebLogic Scripting Tool (WLST) configuration and deployment scripting language, but this is challenging. Such scripts must be carefully updated as the project evolves or the project is deployed to different environments, such as test to production.\nWebLogic Deploy Tooling removes the need for most WebLogic Server deployments to rely on hand-coded WLST scripts for automating routine domain creation and application deployment tasks. It lets you write a declarative, metadata model, describing the domain and applications (with their dependent resources), and provides single-purpose tools that perform domain lifecycle operations based on the content of the model. It also lets you specify simple mutations suitable for moving your model between different environments, such as between test and production.\nWDT provides several single-purpose tools, all exposed as shell scripts (for both Windows and UNIX), that can:\n Create or update a domain. Populate a domain with all the resources and applications specified in a model. Add resources and applications to an existing domain. Introspect an existing domain and create a model file describing the domain and an archive file of the binaries deployed to the domain. Encrypt the passwords in a model (or its variable file). Validate a model as well as provide model usage information. Compare model files. Prepare model files for deploying to the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator environment. Generate a domain resource YAML file for use with the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator. Tokenize a model with variables. Provide information about the folders and attributes that are valid for sections and folders of a domain model.  For detailed information, see WDT Tools.\n Current production release WebLogic Deploy Tooling version and release information can be found here.\n Recent changes and known issues See the Release Notes for known issues and workarounds.\nAbout this documentation This documentation includes sections targeted to different audiences:\n Concepts explains the underlying metadata models and archive files. The User Guide contains detailed usage information, including how to install and configure WebLogic Deploy Tooling, and how to use each tool. The Samples provide informative use case scenarios. The Developer Guide provides details for people who want to understand how WDT is built, its features mapped and implemented. Those who wish to contribute to the WebLogic Deploy Tooling code will find useful information here.
